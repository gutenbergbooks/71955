<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>Having had the honor to spend nineteen
years in your service as resident Land Agent—having
during that period, as well as since, received
from you many marks of favour—having
on your Estate laid the foundation, and to some
extent tested the accuracy, of the opinions which
are given in the following pages; I am, I assure
you, deeply grateful for the kind permission with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</span>
which you have favoured me, to dedicate them
to you.</p>

<p>If I were to allow myself to indulge in the
expression of feelings, which a recollection of my
long connection with your Estates might prompt,
I should risk your displeasure, for I well know,
how distasteful to you would be the language of
adulation; I shall therefore only add, that it gives
me pleasure to dedicate my Book to you, because,
from long experience, I know you to be the zealous
patron of improvement in every department
of rural economy, and because you are practically
and intimately acquainted with the subject on
which I have written.</p>

<p>Encouraging as it would be to me if it were
so, I do not expect that you will concur with me
in all the views to which I have given expression:
nevertheless, I trust I may be allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</span>
to hope that, in the main, the principles which
are developed will approve themselves to your
judgment, and command your approbation.</p>
<br>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p>It has probably been with many others as it
is with the writer of this, who finds the little
which he has to say by way of Preface, more
disagreeable, and more difficult, than he has found
any other part of his book. A Preface, however,
of some sort or other, must be written.</p>

<p>The writer cannot say, as some have done,
that he has pushed off his bark, and is content
to leave it to its fate—he does not pretend, with
Kent, the author of “Hints to Gentlemen of Landed
Property,” that “these hints are published
from no motives of interest whatever”—on the
contrary he is ready to avow, that, while he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
feel it, under a certain modification of circumstances,
a most agreeable and congenial occupation
of his time, to be employed in establishing
a better practice in the management of Woods,
Plantations, &amp;c. he is not in a position to be <em>so</em>
disinterested as altogether to lose sight of his own
interest in the matter. Further: while he feels
it to be an object of vast importance to the great
body of Landed Proprietors, and others, that a
new system should be laid down and acted upon,
the Author wishes not to disguise the fact, that
he seeks the honourable distinction of being permitted
to assist in correcting the evils, which he
thinks he may have been the first so strongly to
point out.</p>

<p>The Author cannot but hope that he has
proved all that can be fairly considered <em>as implied</em>
in his Title; and if he have done so, it may be
productive of much advantage to those who possess
property in Woods, &amp;c.: their attention being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
once strongly called to the subject, they cannot
fail to perceive that there is plenty for them
to do.</p>

<p>The Author needs not to be told, for of that
he is quite conscious—that his book is very defective
in arrangement, and faulty in style, but if
he have succeeded in the attempt to be tolerably
“plain and perspicuous,” and “not very ungrammatical,”
that is as much, perhaps, as ought to
be required of a practical man.</p>

<p>One word is necessary here, with reference to
Sir H. Steuart, whose name, as a Planter, the
Author has mentioned at page <a href="#Page_58">58</a>. He wishes to
correct an impression which he may have produced,
that the honourable Baronet is altogether
opposed to the practice of preparing the soil previous
to planting. This is not the case; but Sir
Henry, with singular inconsistency, after speaking
in the highest terms in favour of trenching, manuring,
&amp;c. declares the practice to be inapplicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
to Plantations on a large scale. It is unnecessary
to remark here, that on this point the Author
is of a different opinion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>P. S. The Author reviews neglected Woods,
Plantations, &amp;c. and gives directions for their
proper management, or he would contract with
any Noblemen or Gentlemen to overlook their
Woods, &amp;c. at so much per acre per year.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p class="no-indent">In writing the few “<span class="smcap">Plain Remarks</span>” which
follow, I shall, in a great measure, confine myself
to the consideration of two main points, viz.—the
<em>present state</em>, and the <em>present mode of managing</em>
such Old Woods, Plantations, and Hedge-Row
Timber, as I deem to be under a course of improper
treatment, suggesting, as I go on, an improved
system of management of them all. Respecting
both these points, I shall have to make statements
which, to me, appear very important—statements,
which I know cannot be controverted,—and
which, though they may apply, as they are
intended to apply, more particularly to some districts
than to others, will, more or less, apply to
all where Woods, Plantations, and well-stocked
Hedge-Rows abound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Upon the second point in particular,—I mean
the present modes of managing property of this
description,—I shall endeavour to show in what
respects, and, as well as I am able, to what
extent, it is erroneous or defective.</p>

<p>But first, I would remark generally, that
although the treatment of Plantations is bad
enough, it is not so grossly bad as is that of
Ancient Woods and Hedge-Row Timber. I have,
for some time, had it in my mind to write respecting
the two latter, having been long convinced
that a most extensive waste of property, and loss
of time, was going on, but, until now, I have
neither had leisure to prepare for, nor confidence
to submit to, a “discerning public,” those views
which have been matured during an eighteen
years observation and experience.</p>

<p>I have now, however, resolved to print, and
whatever may be the precise result to myself, if,
by means of this publication, the attention of
Noblemen and Gentlemen is drawn only to one
hundredth part of their <em>neglected</em> Woods and Plantations,
and of their <em>abused Hedge-Rows</em>, so as to
induce them immediately to determine to arrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the progress of the mischief that is going on, and
not only to commence the work of improvement,
but to proceed to the necessary extent in carrying
it on, two most important results, <em>at least</em>, will be
produced; viz.; to Proprietors themselves a very
considerable present or prospective advantage—in
some cases both—and a large measure of real
benefit to the Labouring Classes, in the increased
demand which will be created for the labour of
their hands. This last object is so vastly important,
that an enlightened and benevolent mind will
always be ready to listen to any suggestions that
may be thrown out to promote it; but at a period
like the present, when one great constitutional
change in our domestic policy has been made, and
when there is too much cause to fear that another
is about to be tried,—each of which is as much
<em>an experiment in morals</em> as any thing else,—it is
invested with a much higher claim on the attention
of those to whom the appeal may be made, than
in ordinary circumstances it would be.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that I refer to the new
Poor Law and to the Corn Laws; the former of
which throws the poor man almost exclusively on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
his own resources. To provide him therefore
with <em>healthful employment</em>, at such a time, and
under such circumstances, will tend more than
any thing else can do, to lessen the difficulty and
danger of the transition from the old to the new
law, and to mitigate the perhaps necessary severity
of the provisions of the latter.</p>

<p>Before I proceed any further I would state, that
I shall not attempt any thing like a systematic
course, nor shall I confine myself to a scientific
arrangement of my subjects: nor again, shall I
trouble myself about the <em>technical</em> names of the
several Trees which I may have to mention: nor,
lastly, is it my intention to aim at elegance of
composition. I do not write to establish a literary
reputation, well knowing that to such an object
I am unequal, and that if it were otherwise, there
is a <em>want of adaptation</em> in my subject; but I wish
to be understood as addressing myself to those
who, not being themselves <em>practically</em> acquainted
with the subjects here treated of, are not unwilling
to listen to the opinions which I have formed, and
profit by the experience which I have derived
from close and extensive observation, while myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
actually employed in the details of management,
connected alike with the Timber and Coppice of
ancient Woods, with the planting and subsequent
treatment of Plantations and with Hedge-Row
Timber.</p>

<p>Of course I am aware that much has been
said, and much has been written, by others who
have preceded me, on these subjects, but notwithstanding
that this be true, I am not at all of
opinion that this branch of rural economy has
received its fair share of attention, or that the
subject has been viewed in that particular aspect
in which it is here presented, highly important
and interesting as that view must be acknowledged
to be, when considered as it affects the growers
of Timber, the labouring poor, and the community
at large.</p>

<p>There will be many, doubtless, who will dissent
from some of my opinions. They will have a
good and sufficient cause to do so, if they adjudge
them to be erroneous: they have just as much
right to hold their opinions as I have to hold mine,
but I wish it to be always remembered by those
who may read the following pages, that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
conclusion to which I have been brought, and
every inference that I have drawn, <em>has had its
origin in actual experience</em>.</p>

<p>To practical men, and more particularly still,
to such practical men as are like myself—to use a
homely phrase—more at home in a Wood or Plantation
than any where else—I need not make more
than a general reference to what they daily see, in
proof of the “mismanagement” which I intend to
show, but as to the Proprietors it surely must be
otherwise. They cannot, one would suppose, be at
all aware of the fact, that one part, and that a most
interesting and valuable part, of their property, is
so <em>mismanaged</em> as to call loudly for an immediate
remedy! I affirm, however, without hesitation, that
while <em>Agriculture</em> has made rapid strides in the
march of improvement, and while that first of all
improvements in Agriculture, <em>Draining</em>—(although
as yet but very imperfectly understood, and, in a
very serious number of cases, <em>very ill done</em>)—has
been extensively attended to—while the adaptation
of Manures (although science has yet much to do,
and much to teach us, on this point) has been
carried to such an extent, as is unparalleled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
any age, and almost in any country but our own;
and withal so successfully, as to turn barren and
hitherto sterile Wastes, Forests, and Moors, into
productive occupations—while such an extraordinary
degree of ingenuity has been applied to the
invention and practical working of different implements,
as to render the operations of husbandry
comparatively simple and easy—and while yet
once more, the attention which has been paid to
the breeding and rearing of the various kinds of
Stock, has raised them to a pitch of excellence
which our forefathers never contemplated, and
which scarcely leaves any room for further effort—while
all this proves, I say, that the large landed
Proprietors of this country, stimulated and assisted
by the skill of the man of science, and by the
enterprize and persevering efforts of the Tenant
Farmer, have paid <em>almost</em> adequate attention to
one part of their estates, it is equally undeniable
that the present condition of <em>a large proportion</em> of
the Woods, Hedge-Rows, and Plantations, furnishes
proof of the grossest neglect, and a perfectly
unaccountable want of attention. To point out
wherein this neglect consists, and to prove this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
want of attention, will be the object of the following
“Remarks.”</p>

<p>It is really surprising that in an age like this,
when there is an onward movement in almost
everything else, such instances of “mismanagement”
of Woods, &amp;c. should every where meet
the eye. If any one well acquainted with the
subject, were to take horse and ride through every
county of the kingdom, he would find in ninety
cases out of a hundred, the Old Woods especially,
to be in as bad a condition as if they were solely
intended for fox or game covers, and incapable of
being turned to any other use. They are permitted
to continue precisely in the same uncultivated
state in which their present possessors found
them, Gentlemen too often totally overlooking
the important fact, that while they might, by
proper attention to the draining and improvement
of their Woods, and the best mode of disposing
of the produce, give employment to a very
considerable number of their poor dependents;
increase the present revenue, and lay the foundation
of a greatly improved permanent income
from them, they would, to a very small extent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
if at all, injure the covers for sporting purposes.</p>

<p>As to Plantations, the treatment may be said
to be somewhat better, but, as I have before said,
in most cases it is bad enough, as I shall hereafter
show.</p>

<p>Of the Hedge-Rows I affirm, that they are,
very generally, either left entirely to themselves,
or to the tender mercies of the occupiers of the
soil, who, having no interest in their success, but
rather the contrary, cannot, of course, be expected
to exercise any care in their preservation.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly introduced the various
subjects which it is my intention to notice more
fully under separate and distinct heads, I shall
commence my first chapter with “Ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>Woods.”</p>

<span class="fs130">ANCIENT WOODS.</span></h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p>While professionally employed, and while
passing from one part of the country to another,
my surprise has often been great, when I have
witnessed, from its effects, the indifference which
many gentlemen manifest, as to the state and
management of this description of property: there
appears, in comparatively few instances, to be any
thing worth the name of an effort to rescue them
from that state of wild unproductiveness in which
they have been for ages! One generation passes
away after another, and like as was the father, so
is the son—and as was the agent of the former, so
is the agent of the latter! All they have done for
ages gone by, they do now, and little or nothing
more. They calculate, with tolerable accuracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the return of the year, when, according to immemorial
custom, they ought to “cut, and hack, and
hew,” and they go into the wood for the purpose
of <em>setting out</em> the piece which they intend to fell:
this they divide, in many districts, into a certain
number of lots, or ranges, of what they call “Gad
Wood,” which vary considerably in size, but
which, as far as they go, include <em>all</em> the Underwood.
At the same time, the sapient woodman
contrives to satisfy himself—and it is seldom that
his superiors make any inquiry into the matter—as
to the number of <em>Oak Trees</em>, &amp;c. that it is proper
to take down; and then, after due notice given, the
whole is sold, Underwood and all, by Auction.</p>

<p>It is a common practice to describe a <em>ring</em>
round a portion of the Standard Trees which are
to remain—such as the Oak, Ash, &amp;c.—and these,
of course, are intended for future timber, the
selection being often as bad as it well can be, but
the whole system, from the beginning to the end,
is most objectionable, and it is matter of astonishment
that it should have continued so long. It is
objectionable for many reasons, among which I
mention the following: viz.: because the Proprietor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
throws out of his own hands that <em>control</em>
which a gentleman ought to have over every
person who enters his woods, whether as a purchaser
or as a workman. This control is absolutely
necessary in order to secure two things,
for which Conditions of Sale, however well they
may be drawn up, offer but a very feeble security—I
mean <em>the prevention of entry by teams, &amp;c.
at an improper season, and the clearing of the
Woods at a given time</em>. There are other reasons
which apply more or less strongly, according to
the condition of the wood, <em>as to its stock, and
the staple of its soil</em>. Carting, or rather <em>teaming</em>,
for carts are not often used, will inevitably
do much injury in woods that are <em>well stocked,
if the utmost possible care is not taken, whatever
the soil may be</em>; but if it be a <em>tenacious,
retentive, cold, clay</em>, damage would be done in two
ways: viz.: in the poaching of the land, and in
that which would be done to the <em>stock</em> by the
<em>wheels</em>. The injury to which woods are liable from
these two causes, and others, may be almost wholly
prevented by the active supervision of an intelligent
woodman. Such a person will take care to divide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
his cuttings as nearly as he can to suit the local
demand, and to begin <em>as early as possible</em>, so that
every opportunity may be seized, in <em>suitable weather</em>,
for getting away the produce, and it must be
his own personal duty to see that no <em>avoidable</em>
injury is done to the stools by the carriages.
These reasons appear to me to be quite sufficient
to establish a decided preference for the mode
which I recommend over the system to which I
have referred; but there is another, which I cannot
but think will be deemed of importance enough
by itself to decide the question, and it is this: viz.:
<em>the impossibility of deciding, before the Underwood
is cut</em>, what Oak Trees <em>ought</em>, or <em>ought not</em>, to
come down. It is quite possible, I admit, to jump
to a <em>conclusion</em> on the subject: to deny this in the
face of the evidence which every succeeding Winter
affords, would be absurd; but I affirm that no
woodman can do it <em>correctly</em>. He ought, at least,
to have a <em>clear coast</em>, to enable him to give due
consideration to the various points on which he
should be fully satisfied, before he cuts down that,
which his whole life would not suffice to set
up again. How little consideration enters into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
these matters, it is easy for those who really understand
them to judge. For my own part, I am
compelled to say, that I never yet saw a single
instance, where timber was selected in the way
to which I refer, without gross blunders being
committed. But more than this may be affirmed—and
it is not an over-weening fondness for my
own plans, but a perfect conviction of the <em>utter
want of adaptation</em> in the present practice of
many, which induces me to say it—there is not
<em>one solitary argument that can be advanced in
favour of the practice which I have condemned</em>.
If this be so, then let all gentlemen abandon it;
if not, let the arguments be brought forward.</p>

<p>I have said that the whole system is wrong,
and I add, that no good will be done by a patchwork
attempt to amend it. So long, for instance,
as a proprietor retains the “Gad-Wood” plan, he
will insure the continuance of the old system of
“mismanagement.” He might as well think of
bending, by his own personal strength, one of the
sturdy stems of his well-grown oaks, as attempt
to turn his woodman gently aside out of his usual
track—especially if he be an old man—there must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
be a total revolution effected—he must be put into
an entirely new course, if either the condition of
the woods, or the revenue arising from them, is to
be improved.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it seldom happens that customers
are not found for all that may be offered,
in almost any neighbourhood, and in any way.
I say unfortunately, inasmuch as it keeps the
managers of many woods exactly <em>stationary</em>,
while everybody else is going on. If they had
a little difficulty to contend with, it might,
perhaps, induce a <em>little</em> reflection, and raise a
doubt in their minds as to the propriety of the
course they were pursuing; which would be a
great point gained, as there has been <em>very little
thought</em> applied to the management of this species
of property, either by its owners, or by the persons
they have employed.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, many refreshing instances
of good management to be met with—I could
myself mention a few, were it not invidious to do
so—but in a large majority of cases, from mistaken
management, woods are in a high degree, and for
many reasons, a discredit to those who belong to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
them. If the Woodman’s account were fairly examined—if
a <em>Dr.</em> and <em>Cr.</em> balance sheet were
exhibited, it would be found that the land was
paying <em>a very small rent indeed from the underwood,
even where there might be very little oak</em>,
which most assuredly ought not to be the case;
for I contend that there is no Ancient Woodland
which is not considerably below the average
quality of what I have seen, that is not quite
capable of <em>growing a full crop</em>—either of underwood
or of oak; and for this plain reason,
viz.; because <em>the period of pecuniary sacrifice,
the infancy of the wood</em>, is gone by: and
that woodman’s management is essentially defective,
who cannot show, upon <em>every</em> acre
under his care, a good crop either of the one
or the other. I would here remark, that a <em>full
crop of both</em> cannot contemporaneously grow
up together; and this consideration is of far
more importance in the management of woods
than is at first sight imagined, or, than by a
slight acquaintance with the subject would be
perceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>If there is found in a wood a superabundance
of oaks, and if they are seen to be <em>thrifty</em>, nothing
could possibly be so <em>ill judged</em> as to <em>thin them too
freely</em>, even though the <em>crop of underwood were
entirely sacrificed</em>; for, the very objects most to
be desired, can only be attained by bringing about
that state of things which is here supposed, and
which necessarily involves <em>the sacrifice of the
underwood</em>, or, at the least, all idea of any considerable
<em>profit</em> from it. Under these circumstances,
the exertions of the skilful Woodman will be
directed to the securing of <em>great length of bole or
stem</em>; for these, and these alone, are the trees
which have any legitimate right to a place in
a wood: and, of course, the longer their boles
are, the better.</p>

<p>Having attained this object, the woodman will
then anxiously employ the best means in his
power, for encouraging the growth of the underwood,
so far as, at least, to <em>keep it alive</em>, and <em>as
healthy</em> as possible; and if he have well considered
the subject, he will have contrived to lay down a
plan, a regularly systematic plan, that his successors
can neither mistake, nor, without some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
good reason, depart from, by which, during the
period that the crop of oaks is being taken, the
stock of underwood shall gradually be acquiring
strength and vigour, and getting well hold of the
soil; as well as that, they shall be so equally diffused
over it, as fully and beneficially to occupy
the ground, <em>when the oaks are all gone</em>. All
these calculations, and many more, which it is
impossible to enumerate, will suggest themselves
to the mind of a man well-skilled in the management
of woods; but there are very few indeed,
who either see the necessity of making, or will
give themselves the trouble to make, any calculations
at all. In the oversight of woods, &amp;c.
much more is included than is generally supposed.
He who imagines, as too many do, that when
woods have been cut, they may be safely left to
themselves; and that when the period comes
round again for felling, they will do all that could
be expected from them, has a very imperfect
knowledge of the subject, or, rather, no knowledge
at all: and further; he who does not know that
woods will ultimately pay well for the highest
degree of care, attention, and culture, is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
fitting person to have the oversight of them. But
such is the ignorance on the part of many, who
call themselves woodmen, and the carelessness of
their employers, that there is a total negation of
<em>forethought</em> and <em>calculation</em>, instead of every step
that is taken having reference to a remote period.</p>

<p>A nobleman, or gentleman, or his agent, may
calculate what will be the effect upon a farm at
the expiration of a lease of twenty-one years, if it
be not cultivated as it ought to be, and, by introducing
certain clauses into the lease, he may
secure himself against the certain and serious loss
which would accrue to him from bad management;
and he who does not so calculate, has a very inadequate
idea of the nature of the contract which
he is about to make; but the man who takes upon
himself the management of woods, and whose views
and plans are not extended over <em>several of those
cycles of time which intervene between the seasons of
cutting</em>, does not rightly comprehend the peculiar
duties which he has undertaken to perform, and
ought, at once, to be relieved from them, and provided
for in some other way; for if woods are
worth having at all, they are worth looking after,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and <em>if they will pay for proper culture</em>, which no
one who understands the subject will deny, they
ought to receive it, for various weighty reasons,
which have been before adverted to.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks will apply, of course,
most directly, to woods where there is an <em>apparent
redundancy</em> of oak. I will now suppose the case of a
wood where there is a <em>deficiency</em>, or little or no oak.
Here there ought, unquestionably, to be <em>a full crop
of underwood</em>. This underwood ought to be
adapted, as to <em>kind</em>, first, to the nature of the soil;
and, secondly, to the <em>local demand, if the local
demand be good</em>: and as to its <em>age</em>, of course it
must be that which best suits the market, or when,
comparatively, it will fetch the best price; so that
in some districts, as in Kent, for instance, it will
<em>sell</em> best, and therefore ought to be <em>cut</em>, at about
twelve years of age: in others it would not sell
so well at less than from fifteen to twenty years
old. But it does <em>not</em> follow as a matter of course,
that because a wood has always, previously, stood
from twenty to twenty-five years, it should for
ever continue to do so; on the contrary, I should
say, that there are <em>very few woods indeed, if any</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
which ought to stand more than twenty years, and
a great proportion of them, nothing like so long.
The great reason why the produce of woods does not
earlier come to maturity, is the gross “mismanagement”
to which they are subjected: but when the
time shall arrive that they shall be deemed worthy
of as much “care, attention, and culture,” as any
other part of an estate, then will they be found,
probably, to yield quite as good a return for it;
and the present <em>no system</em> management will be
exploded.</p>

<p>In all cases where the cycle has run beyond
twenty years, it will, at least, be well for the
proprietor, or his manager, to sit down and calculate
whether the stuff would not pay better if
felled some years earlier. The inquiry can do no
harm; and much good may possibly arise out of it.
In the case last supposed, viz.: a wood with little
or no oak, <em>and well stocked with underwood of a
suitable kind</em>, there cannot be a doubt upon the
subject; for if the stock—by which term I mean
the shoots which have sprung up from the stools—has
been properly treated, it will have arrived, in
twenty years, at a size quite large enough for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
agricultural uses, and it can very seldom be
allowed to stand longer without <em>serious injury to
the stools</em>. A very little consideration will convince
any one, who does not resist conviction, that such
ought to be the state of a wood so circumstanced
as to oak; but nevertheless the actual condition
of most woods is widely different from this: instead
of there being a full crop of underwood, where
there is a deficiency of timber, or a full crop of
timber, where there is little or no underwood, it
too frequently happens that there is neither the
one nor the other, even on land which is, as was
remarked before, capable of yielding a handsome
revenue! And here let it not be supposed that
I am speaking of <em>extreme cases only</em>, or that there
are but <em>few</em> woods in this state: the cases are
numerous: I have seen, and could point out many,
but this I shall not do: I rather choose to leave
these observations with “all whom they may concern,”
to work conviction where they are seen to
be <em>just</em>, quite indifferent as to the effect which
they may produce on the minds of any who may
oppose them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>And now let me ask—<em>if this be the state of
many woods—if neither a crop of timber nor of
underwood is found—to what is it owing?</em> the
reply is not difficult: it is <em>mainly</em> attributable to
proprietors themselves, and to their agents: to
woodmen in a subordinate degree. In proof of my
first position, I would respectfully remark, that if
a gentleman <em>chooses</em> to sacrifice every thing to the
idea of having <em>good covers</em>; and, supposing that
any thing which interferes with the primeval state
of his woods, is incompatible with this object,
<em>refuses to do any thing at them</em>, the woodman may
not bear the blame. Again: if a proprietor happen,
unfortunately, to have <em>such an aversion to
felling timber</em>—and there are many such—that he
will sooner let it <em>rot down</em>, or <em>allow one tree to
destroy another</em>; or again; suffer the timber trees
to stand so thickly that they not only totally
destroy each other, but the underwood below also,
the woodman ought not to be censured; except
indeed, he have advised such a course, which I
can hardly think any man accustomed to woods
could do, in the present day. Once more; if
gentlemen lack the moral courage—and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
met with <em>some</em> of this description—to treat with
the contempt which it deserves the vulgar meddling,
the idle tattle of those who are ever ready
to say, when timber is felled, that the owner’s
<em>poverty</em>, and not his <em>will</em>, consents to the deed, we
are furnished with abundance of reasons for the
serious waste of property that is going on, but the
woodman is not in fault, neither ought he to be
blamed. Lastly: if proprietors commit the management
of their woods to persons who are wholly
incompetent—as is too often the case—to discharge
the duties confided to them, I cannot see that the
men are to be condemned, but rather their employers.
Wherever such “mismanagement”
prevails as I have attempted to describe, and
have seen so much cause to lament, it may generally,
I think, be traced, either to ignorance on the
part of woodmen, or inattention on the part of
their employers: but it will be quite clear to all,
who will allow themselves time to think on the
subject, that the <em>grossest</em> mismanagement is to be
met with, not on first, nor even on second, but
on <em>third</em>, and <em>fourth-rate</em> estates, where <em>regular
woodmen</em> are not kept, and below that grade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
downwards, to property which is in the hands of
Trustees, or mainly under the control of Solicitors,
or Corporate bodies; or, which is probably worse
than all, under the supreme direction of men who
having, during the whole of their business life, had
too many Stewardships, &amp;c. <em>for any human being
to look after and manage well</em>, cannot of course be
deemed capable of judging rightly on a subject
which requires <em>the closest possible attention, the
nicest discrimination, and an extended and varied
experience</em>.</p>

<p>Much mischief has also arisen from the employment
by gentlemen, and by their agents, of
persons, who, while they may, usefully and creditably,
fulfil their duties as village carpenters and
the like, cannot possibly possess those enlarged,
comprehensive views, which are necessary to the
proper management of timber generally, and
Ancient Woods especially. I must here protest
against the conclusion being drawn, that I am
doing injustice to any class of men in remarking,
as I have done, on their manner of discharging the
trust committed to them. As to the professional
gentlemen, either their <em>engagements</em>, their <em>position</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
or their <em>habits</em>, interpose an insurmountable difficulty,
and relieve them from the charge of wilful
neglect: and as to the others it is no injustice to
them to affirm, as I do most positively, that there
are principles and considerations involved in this
subject, which they can, in no wise, grasp or
comprehend: and so perfectly clear is this to me,
so fully am I borne out by a long course of “observation
and experience,” that I have never yet
seen one solitary instance, where <em>the timber taken
down in thinning</em>, either in woods or plantations,
<em>when in such hands</em>, has been properly done; and
in <em>very few</em> cases indeed, either here, or higher
up the scale, without the most <em>serious blunders</em>.
One case has fallen under my observation this
Winter, (1842,) where <em>oak timber trees were
selected and marked for sale, which were exactly,
in every respect, such as a good judge would wish
to see in every wood; and not only, not too thick,
but, from the same injudicious mode of selecting
and marking at previous auctions, much too thin</em>.
They were also in a state of <em>high vigorous health</em>,
and moreover, there was no underwood which
could be benefited! I admit that this was a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
flagrant outrage against the principles which ought
to rule in selecting, than is usually committed, but
the work is hardly ever done as it ought to be.</p>

<p>But whatever difference of opinion may arise
among practical men, upon the points now under
consideration, and on whomsoever the blame may
rest, it is unquestionable that the actual state of
a large proportion of our Ancient Woods is very
bad indeed: they are either crowded <em>with inferior
oak timber</em>, along with the most miserable rubbish
as underwood; or, if they contain any thing valuable
in either the one or the other, no <em>principles</em>,
or rules of any kind, are applied in the management
of them; and, consequently, they are, on
some account or other, and of course more or less
rapidly, <em>passing through the stage of deterioration</em>,
and are annually losing to their owners, <em>a heavy
per centage on their value</em>. In many cases, the
oak, from ages of “mismanagement,” is stunted in
growth, and of a <em>form, and shape, totally unsuited
to the place where it stands</em>; and the underwood
consists of that alone which is indigenous to the
soil, and which, therefore, no neglect can destroy,
nor any culture improve: in addition to all this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
they are often, nay almost always, on clayey,
retentive soils, <em>ruined with water</em>: they are periodically
<em>shut up</em>, for from eighteen to twenty-five
years, during which time, it is impossible to do
any thing at them; and, when they are cleared
of the underwood, instead of the opportunity being
gratefully seized, for the purpose of effecting those
operations which can only be carried on at such
a time, they are <em>shut up again</em>, and left in their
original state—except indeed they may have been
despoiled of some of their oak—nothing being <em>done
at them</em>, or, if any thing, probably so little, or so
<em>ill</em> done, that no good result is produced. But
what ought to be the course pursued at such a
time? Why, as it is only during the year of
“hagging,” and the following season, that any
work of magnitude, any improvement worth mentioning,
can be carried on; a proprietor should
more carefully examine his woods when they have
been cut, than he would any other description of
property: he should himself, if he understand it—which,
however, is very seldom the case—or if he
do not, by a person who is conversant with such
matters, make a most rigid, and particular survey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
in order to satisfy himself <em>as to what ought to be
done</em>; and this he must do <em>immediately when the
underwood is cut</em>, or rather, as soon as any considerable
portion is done, so that he may have
before him <em>all the time which he can possibly
command</em>, for carrying on, and completing, his
improvements. He must not be deterred from
commencing them by any consideration of <em>the
remoteness of the prospect of return upon his outlay</em>;
but, instead of visiting the sins of his fathers
upon the generations following him, he must, if
the case demand it, make a <em>present</em> sacrifice, for
the benefit of his posterity: I say if the case
<em>demand</em> it, but this will not very frequently happen,
as there are very few instances of “mismanagement”
where <em>the fear of cutting timber</em>
has not been one of the principal causes of that
mismanagement; and where this is so, there is at
once found a source from whence may be obtained
<em>the means of amply paying for any outlay that
may be required</em>. I have thus far remarked only
on what may, and what ought to be done, when
Ancient Woods come to be <em>felled in the regular
way</em>, and <em>at the usual time and age</em>; but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
are vast numbers of cases where, first, the condition
of the woods is so bad, that all considerations
about the <em>usual</em> time, are merged in the necessity
for immediately commencing the work of renovation;
and, secondly, the instances are not few,
where the same course is desirable, in order that
a more profitable way of disposing of the produce
may be introduced, to supersede the old jog-trot
mode of getting rid of it.</p>

<p>With regard to the first, it will at once be
perceived, by a practical eye, and a sound judgment,
whether a wood is in such a state, <em>as to the
prospect of a crop</em>, that it is the proprietor’s interest
to <em>make a sacrifice in the underwood</em> and <em>cut it</em>,
although it may sell for nothing but faggots, <em>rather
than finish, or run out, the term, at the end of
which it would be cut in the usual course</em>. I have
seen hundreds of such cases: there are many
in almost every neighbourhood where woods exist
at all; and I confidently ask, what would be the
use, or how would it be possible to show the propriety,
of completing the term of the cycle, if,
first, <em>the wood contained nothing valuable as underwood</em>;
and if, secondly, <em>it contained a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
portion of timber that required immediate attention</em>,
on some account or other? I should, for instance,
instantly determine to cut, where I found a wood
crowded with a class of unhealthy oaks, or other
timber: but it is not necessary to particularize, as
I would not pretend to give such directions here
as would enable a gentleman to decide, for that
could only be done <em>after inspection</em>. So many
points have to be considered, that a careful survey
of a wood must be made. This done, fortunately
there is no difficulty in coming to a correct conclusion
upon such a question as this. A practical
man, who understands what he is about, will be
in no danger of committing an error in the decision
to which he will be led, for these are not subjects
on which a difference of opinion might naturally
arise upon an examination taken. The various
considerations for <em>cutting</em>, or <em>forbearing to cut</em>,
would <em>so certainly present themselves</em> to the mind
of a person <em>really competent to judge</em>, that I should
say there would be no doubt whatever, of his
deciding correctly, if he were not interfered with
by the personal wish, or taste, of his employer.
It is with this as with most other subjects:—wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
men understand what they are about,
and are guided and governed by <em>fixed principles</em>,
matters go on well; but the misfortune, with regard
to woods, is, that ages of “mismanagement,”
and other causes, interpose obstacles and difficulties
which it will be no slight task to overcome.
To give a brief summary of my views upon this
important point, I would remark, that no wood
ought to be allowed to <em>run out its term</em> which is
not <em>stocked as it ought to be</em>, or which, if stocked
tolerably well, <em>is suffering injury from imperfect
drainage</em>. As I have just said, these points must
be determined by an examination of the wood by
some person whose judgment may be relied upon;
but any gentleman may see at once, if he will,
that if a wood is really in the state which I have
supposed, viz., without either timber or underwood
<em>worth standing</em>, &amp;c. it would be perfectly absurd
to <em>let it stand</em>; for at the end of the cycle it would
be very little better than at the beginning, and so
much more time would be irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>As to the second point—<em>the improvement of
revenue to be derived from a different mode of
disposing of the produce</em>, I am of opinion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
much might be done, in many places, without
laying an increased tax on the local buyers, who
are generally either farmers, or their tradesmen,
the wheelwrights and carpenters of every neighbourhood,
and who already pay quite enough for
what they get; and especially the <em>former</em>, to
whom I would much sooner recommend their
landlords to allow an <em>abatement</em>, as an encouragement
to them to keep their fences, gates, &amp;c. in
good order, than any thing in the shape of an
advance. But still, much may be done to increase
the returns from woodland property, by an improved
system of management, and, first, I should
advise <em>a careful assortment of the stuff after it is
felled</em>: I would here, as in every thing else,
<em>classify</em>, by which means, the different kinds, as
well as the different sizes, and shapes, will come
into the hands of such persons as they may exactly
suit, instead of jumbling all sorts together, so that
a buyer is obliged to purchase that which he <em>does
not want</em>, in order to come at another portion of
the same lot which he is desirous of having.</p>

<p>Secondly: There is room to doubt, I think, as
hinted before, whether mistakes are not often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
made, in not adapting the produce of woods better
as to its <em>age</em>, both to the local demand, and the
interests of the proprietor.</p>

<p>Thirdly: So numerous are the facilities in the
present day, to what they used to be, for the transmission
of produce of every kind from one place
to another, and so many demands have, by commercial
enterprize, been opened out, which were
altogether unknown a quarter of a century ago,
that it may, even as to heavy produce, like that
of woods, be always questioned, <em>when the demand
is slack, and when prices are low, whether the
local market be indeed the best market</em>, or whether
the produce may not be much better disposed of
in some other way. That this sometimes occurs,
I can prove from my own experience in many
cases, but I will mention only one, which was
that of an Ancient Wood, a twentieth portion of
which was felled every year, and in which, from
“mismanagement,” a large quantity of the stuff
was annually left unsold, but where, after the
introduction of a better system, the whole was
disposed of without difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Fourthly: A great increase of revenue may
be derived from <em>a better mode of managing the
stock</em>, both of timber and underwood: the latter
may, by timely and judicious pruning, by a proper
attention to draining, &amp;c. <em>be brought to maturity</em>
at a much earlier period than it has hitherto been
done in many places, and thus, of course, be made
to return a greater rent.</p>

<p>It is incredible how little is done to Ancient
Woods compared with what ought to be done, <em>in
the way of draining, pruning, stubbing up rubbish</em>,
and <em>filling up with young plants</em>; although
it is manifest that, whenever a wood is opened,
these important operations <em>should</em> claim the very
particular attention of the proprietor or his woodman.
But they do not receive it; and hence one
cannot wonder at the <em>stunted, unhealthy</em> appearance,
which many woods exhibit. They are
almost always without any <em>effective drainage</em>, it
being generally thought quite sufficient to open
out a few paltry drains, which the falling leaves
of the first Autumn will <em>choke</em> up. It will indeed
very seldom be found, that even the outside ditches
are well looked after: whereas it should always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
be the anxious concern of the woodman to provide,
as well as he possibly can, for the <em>effectual drainage</em>
of a wood after being felled, not only during
a year or two, but for the term of the whole cycle.
Of course I am aware that the leaves <em>must</em> fall,
and, consequently, that the free egress of the
water must, in some degree, be <em>impeded</em>, but,
nevertheless, it is in the power of the woodman to
provide, in a great measure, if not wholly, against
this contingency, by making a sufficient number
of ditches, of <em>ample capacity</em>, and by putting them
in the best direction. But instead of this, it will
very rarely be found, as I have just now said,
that even the outside ditches are properly attended
to. The consequence is, that the <em>oaks</em>, and our
best underwood, the ash, not liking too much
moisture, become diseased, and make comparatively
slow progress: in fact, their <em>existence</em> is
shortened by it, as the former will be found upon
cold clay land, having a strong subsoil, to be very
stunted and sickly in their appearance, and ultimately
to die at the top, when, of course, they
must be cut down; while the latter will much
sooner become hollow, and they too, will finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
perish. A small outlay in draining, if judiciously
expended, would, in most cases, prevent these
effects, and as it would only require to be done
once in fifteen or twenty years, it could not lay
more than a trifling charge upon the land.</p>

<p>Pruning is also a very necessary operation in
Ancient Woods, both of the oak and of the underwood.
I shall not here enter upon an inquiry into
<em>the general question of pruning</em>, but, continuing to
treat my subject practically, venture to remark,
that, as our woods are now circumstanced, pruning,
of some kind or other, is, as far as the oak is
concerned, quite <em>indispensable</em>. Whether it should
be by <em>fore-shortening</em>, <em>close pruning</em>, or some other
method, must be determined upon an examination
taken, but I do not hesitate to express my belief,
that <em>the pruning of oak trees in woods</em>, may be
almost wholly dispensed with, after the few first
years, <em>if they are well trained from the beginning</em>;
but that being the case with very few, pruning
<em>must</em> be resorted to. And as to the underwood,
the question has still less difficulty in it. When
a wood is well stocked with underwood of the right
sort, the object to be aimed at by the woodman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
is <em>to bring it to maturity as soon as possible</em>, and
one means which he possesses, if he will make use
of it, is <em>pruning</em>; which he should commence,
after one year’s growth, and occasionally repeat—say
on the fourth and sixth years, allowing the
intervals to pass without interfering with it. If
this operation be performed as it ought to be, the
stools will have a number of poles proportioned to
their size and capacity of supporting them, and
the poles themselves will not only be more of an
uniform size, but they will be much straighter, and
on every account better adapted to the use for
which they may be intended. But if a wood be
stocked with nothing but rubbish, such as hazel,
birch, alder, &amp;c. it will not be <em>worth</em> pruning, and
the best course to take with it, would be to <em>stub it
up</em>, and get rid of it altogether.</p>

<p>Finally, on this point, and more particularly
with reference to timber, if the pruning be <em>judiciously
done</em>, it will tend greatly to improve the
health of the wood, but <em>the indiscriminate</em> use of
the pruning knife might do much harm, it should,
therefore, only be done under the most careful
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p><em>Stubbing up rubbish</em>, such as <em>thorns</em>, <em>briers</em>,
<em>birch</em>, and, in many places, <em>hazel</em>, is much to be
recommended, as by this means, light and air will
be admitted more freely, and the health of the
wood promoted, and, of course, its growth facilitated.
It is perhaps just possible, that there may
be a few cases where the demand may be such
for birch, hazel, or alder, as to warrant a woodman
in keeping them as a part of his stock; but I have
generally found, upon inquiry, that they have
fetched such a miserable price, as to yield very
little more than would pay expences.</p>

<p><em>The absolute necessity of filling up with young
plants</em> must be universally admitted, although <em>in
practice</em>, it is very rarely done, or, if done at all,
it is very generally so ill done, as to produce no
perceptible improvement in the stock.</p>

<p>It too often happens that sufficient care is not
bestowed in <em>selecting the plants</em>. They are frequently
put in <em>too small</em>, and when they are long
enough, they are often <em>deficient in thickness</em>. All
plants put into old woods, should be of <em>good size</em>,
<em>stiff</em>, and <em>well rooted</em>. Again: it will be admitted,
that they are often planted in a most slovenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and careless manner.—The following is a specimen
of what I have <em>seen</em>. The workman takes his
spade, and inserts it in the ground as far as it will
go, <em>in a sloping direction</em>; he then raises it to a
<em>perpendicular position</em>, which, of course, produces
a “<em>nick</em>,” into which he <em>thrusts the plant</em>, and
having put his heavy foot upon it, there and thus,
he leaves it to its fate, and pursues his ill-directed
labour, without a gleam of light breaking in upon
him, as to the possibility of his being more usefully
employed, or doing his work in a more
effective manner! In this way, or in some such
way as this, thousands of acres of Ancient Woods
are treated every year; but it must be clear to
every one, that such a practice is a disgrace to
those who pursue it. If the workmen are asked
their opinion of it, they will, in most cases, assure
you, that the plants will “<em>all grow</em>,” but the
misfortune is, that <em>experience</em> is against them.
Both theory and practice are directly opposed to
their view. But independently of facts, which
every where condemn such methods, no one acquainted
with the <em>rudiments</em> of the subject, needs
to be told, that it is utterly unlikely that either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
an oak or an ash plant should grow, under the
manifest disadvantages in which it is placed, when
its roots are thus <em>jumbled together</em>, and forced into
a “<em>nick</em>” fit only for a willow set; and when,
moreover, it has to commence its course in competition
with other underwood, which has already
possession of the ground. It is absurd to suppose
that it should succeed.</p>

<p>I do not presume to say that some woods do
not receive different treatment, in <em>all</em> respects, to
that which I have denounced: that would not be
true; but these are the exceptions, and even
where the management is best, there is much to
complain of.</p>

<p>In commencing the subject of Planting, I am
impressed with a sense of the importance which
should be attached to it in such a work as this.
I mean planting by way of filling up, in Ancient
Woods. I am quite aware that it demands such
a largeness and comprehension of view, that it
might well be supposed likely to discourage one
of stouter nerves than mine. It is important
because, first, every wood in the kingdom ought
to be <em>well planted</em>, whether it is or not: It is so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
secondly, because there are very few that are
properly planted.</p>

<p>As I have stated before, the infancy of a
wood, or plantation, is the only time when it cannot
be expected to pay. After it has arrived at a
certain age, say from fifteen to twenty years, it
ought to begin to make <em>some</em> return. In woods,
if they are properly planted, it will necessarily be
small during the first two cycles of twenty years
each. It must be observed, that I am here
speaking of the first forty years of an <em>Ancient</em>
Wood, supposing it to have been thoroughly purged
of its rubbish, retaining all the valuable stock,
and to have been re-planted. The return must
be small, because the oaks will have been planted
thickly, in order that they may acquire great
length of bole: and this being the case, whatever
underwood may have been put in, it will be treated
with direct reference to the health and prosperity
of the entire class of timber trees. After the
expiration of the first cycle, that portion of the
stuff put in for underwood will be cut over, and
such pruning of the oak as may be required
(which will be very slight) will be done, care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
being taken never to lose sight of the principle of
<em>classification of the oaks, into certain families of
larger or smaller size, according to the term which
a skilful woodman will allot for their entire existence</em>.
This is of immense consequence, and will
embrace calculations, and a knowledge of the
habits of trees, which can only be acquired by
“close observation and long experience.” Where
a sufficient number of oaks have been introduced,
the <em>underwood</em> will yield very little return per
acre, even at the end of the second cycle; but if
the wood has been well managed, it will have
been kept alive and tolerably healthy; and when
it is cut, at the end of forty years, a considerable
number of oaks of a useful size for farmers, wheelwrights,
&amp;c. will be taken down: this will admit
light and air, and in a slight degree, perhaps,
improve the position of the underwood during the
course of the third cycle.</p>

<p>I need not pursue the subject farther here, having,
I trust, succeeded in opening to the reader a
general view of the plan which should be pursued.
But there are other woods where a larger portion,
both of oak and of underwood, will be found, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
where, consequently, it will be more the object of
the woodman to improve by <em>less extensive measures</em>
than would be adopted in such a case as the
one just referred to. It will mostly be best to
do this by pruning, stubbing, and planting—always
supposing that an effectual drainage has been
secured—and here I would remark, that whenever
planting is done in a wood, it should be as well
done as circumstances will possibly allow. Instead
of the “nick” system, or any similar plan, the
woodman should dig holes for the underwood in
the Autumn, and plant in February, or early in
March. For oak, he should dig a larger hole, in
the Autumn, give it a Summer fallow, and put
in a vigorous, stiff plant, the Autumn following,
or in the February next but one. If some such
plan as this were pursued, there is not much fear
but the plants would grow, and in this way woods
may be gradually brought into a prosperous state,
instead of their being, as they now are, in the
aggregate, a <em>comparatively</em> valueless property to
their owners.</p>

<p>I may here illustrate my view by a reference
to a particular case, which came under my professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
notice. It was a wood held on lease by
a gentleman, under an ecclesiastical body, the
lease being for a certain number of years, renewable
upon the payment of a fine every seven years.
Some dissatisfaction was felt by the lessee at the
amount of the fines demanded, and the lease was
permitted to <em>lapse</em>, at which time the intrinsic
value of the stock, whether of timber or <em>underwood</em>,
was literally nothing. The oak was all
gone, as it was quite natural that, with a lease so
framed, it should be, and the underwood, instead
of being usefully and beneficially occupying the
ground, of which it then had <em>entire possession</em>, was
not worth the trouble of cutting! How different
would have been the position of the lessors in this
instance, I need not say, if, during the two last
cycles, when the oaks were becoming very thinly
scattered, the underwood had been cherished, as
it most undoubtedly ought to have been. The
neighbourhood was one where there was plenty of
demand for the produce of woods; the particular
wood referred to, would have been, on every account,
as good a cover, and all parties would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
have been alike interested in the continuance of
the lease.</p>

<p>But as I must now very shortly bring such
of my “Remarks” as refer to “Ancient Woods,”
to a close, it may be as well just to run over the
whole subject in a recapitulary form, so as to
present it to the reader in a sort of bird’s-eye
view.</p>

<p>I have, then, endeavoured to show, that the
present state of the Ancient Woods of this kingdom
is very far from what it ought to be, and
fully proves that their owners have paid little
attention to them: that they are almost valueless
to them, simply and only for want of better management:
that they are capable of such a degree
of improvement as would insure from them a fair,
reasonable return: I have endeavoured to show
this by contrasting the plans of woodmen, if they
can be said to have any, with those which, in my
judgment, ought to be pursued; and I am not
aware that I have, upon any one point, exposed
the errors of their course, without suggesting that
which I conceive would be the right one. It is
quite impossible, however, to lay down in a book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
like this, or in any other, specific rules or directions
which shall constitute a sufficient guide for
the manager of woods, out of the difficulties of a
false position, or enable him to reform the errors
of a vicious practice: for, first, not one woodman
in fifty would be convinced, by any process of
reasoning, that the present state of woods is so
bad as I have described it to be; and if they
would not admit the existence of the evil, they
would not be likely to perceive the value of any
remedial measures that might be recommended.
Next: a difficulty would every where present itself,
if woods were improperly treated, from the
woodman feeling that the introduction of any new
plans would, necessarily, involve the condemnation
of his own. Besides all this, as I have remarked
before, so many things have to be considered as to
the state of a wood, before a safe opinion could be
given as to the best course to be taken with it,
that nothing less than a minute examination, affording
the opportunity of duly weighing all the
circumstances of each particular case, would justify
any man in suggesting a specific course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>In proof of this, I would offer the example of
a wood which I will suppose to be of forty years
standing, and to have been started with as many
oak plants as would suffice to insure a sufficient
number of timber trees, possessing ample length
of bole, or stem. Upon the plan of management
which I have suggested, there would be, at the
second cutting of the under wood, a certain number
of oaks to cut out also, and from the stools
of these, there would start young shoots, which,
if <em>properly dealt with</em>, would, with those which
would spring from every subsequent cutting, furnish
a succession of timber trees; but if no care
were taken in <em>nursing</em> them, the probability is,
that they would be unfit for timber, and that it
would therefore be necessary, occasionally, to introduce
a small number of maiden plants, even as
early as the expiration of the second cycle.</p>

<h3>Present Modes of Planting.</h3>

<p>Much may, and probably ought, to be said,
on the errors of bad planters: it is indeed a prolific,
as well as an important subject; and if there
were any solid ground on which to rest a hope
that an exposure of all the mistakes which are
made in planting, would lead to the abandonment
of such plans and practices as would be shown to
be wrong, it would be a duty worthy the exercise
of talents of the highest order. It does not, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
absolutely <em>require</em> the aid of brilliant talent,
or fervid eloquence, to place these matters in their
proper light before those who are most concerned;
a plain reference to facts will be quite sufficient
for that purpose.</p>

<p>The case of an Ancient Wood in an unthrifty
and unprofitable condition, does not stand out so
prominently—it is not so glaringly discreditable
to its owner, as is a Plantation in the same state,
which has been made by himself; for as to the
former, the fact that “<em>it always was so</em>,” is, to a
certain extent, an excuse for bad management;
and in truth, it will generally be found a very difficult
affair, as I have hinted before, to establish
a <em>new system</em> where the prejudice of ages, in
favour of an <em>old one</em>, will meet the person who
may attempt it, at every turn; but it is not so
as to Plantations; when, therefore, a gentleman
decides to plant, and has himself to do with the
work <em>from the beginning</em>, both his interest, and
his duty, point out the necessity of his seeing that
it be <em>well done</em>; but the very reverse of this, is
the <em>average</em> of the general practice, as I shall
presently show. It would be quite foreign to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
purpose, to refer to the minor shades of difference
which exist in the practice of planters: such difference
indeed may be met with, between plans
which are each in themselves excellent; I shall
content myself, therefore, with referring, and that
in general terms, to the most glaring mistakes
which are committed, giving a few examples.</p>

<p>To an eye that can take in the whole, it is
lamentable to see the effects of ignorance and
neglect, in the original formation, as well as in
the subsequent treatment, of Plantations! With
many, it seems to be expected that they will
thrive and prosper, no matter how they may be
put in, whereas the very contrary is the fact.
With many planters there is a vague, indefinite
notion—of course there is no <em>calculation</em>—that
when once they are planted, trees will grow, not
only without labour or culture, but under such
adverse circumstances as at once convince the
experienced planter of the utter impossibility of
their doing so. As I have elsewhere said, a <em>young</em>
child, a <em>young</em> animal, and a <em>young</em> tree, all require
the greatest possible attention, and the tenderest
treatment; and the blighting effects which must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
result, and which do result, from <em>the absence of
early attention</em>, are to be seen quite as strongly
marked in the last, as in the other two.</p>

<p>In numerous instances—and this I shall call
mistake the first—the trees are put in without
any <em>previous preparation of the soil</em>. It is not
possible, in the ordinary run of cases, to commit
a greater error than this. It is, emphatically, to
build upon a bad foundation, and it is very rarely
indeed that Plantations, so commenced, ever make
any thing out. When I say this, I do not mean
to assert that they never become trees of any size:
<em>unfortunately they do</em>, in some situations, and men
are so ignorant—there is so little real scientific
knowledge of the subject to be met with anywhere—that
the most erroneous conclusions are
drawn from this fact. The question as to what a
Plantation might have done, or what it <em>would</em>
have done, if it had been properly treated, is never
thought of! No one ever dreams of instituting a
comparison between such a Plantation as <em>it is</em>,
and <em>as it ought to have been</em>. And yet this is the
very first question which should be asked, or
rather which should be <em>anticipated</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>But the majority of Plantations, which are
commenced without any preparation of the soil, are
complete failures, as may be seen by any one who
chooses to take the trouble to examine for himself.</p>

<p>Influenced by a most mistaken notion of
economy, many persons plant their trees on land
which is already fully occupied—it may be, by ling,
by bracken, or by long grass, or twitch—and in
most cases of this sort, the greater number die;
but there may probably remain a few which sustain
a feeble existence, so as just to make <em>a show of
a Plantation</em>, and the owner seldom gives himself
the trouble to attempt to ascertain why it is no
better. The method usually adopted, when planting
is done in this way, is, to dig small holes at
fixed distances, into which the plants are put by
the workman in the best manner that he can, and
they are left to fight their way as best they may.</p>

<p>Mr. Withers, of Holt, in Norfolk, has ably,
and indignantly, denounced the hole-digging system,
and has shown, most clearly, the advantage
of “<em>the highest degree of culture</em>,” for raising
timber, whether as a pecuniary question, or where
it is wanted for merely ornamental purposes. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
is true that an opinion at variance with his, has
been given by some, but every practical man will,
at once, perceive where the truth lies; nor will
he be at any loss, whether, in the preparation of
a field for planting, to follow the directions of Sir
Henry Steuart, or those of Mr. Withers.</p>

<p>It was the practice of the latter gentleman, to
trench his ground from “fourteen to eighteen inches
deep,” and on poor land, to “put on as much
manure as if turnips were intended to be sown,”
and to hoe and keep clean the land, <em>for seven
years after planting</em>. The results were, extraordinary
rapidity of growth, and a consequent
early and ample return upon the capital invested,
in addition to the full accomplishment of an object,
which is, of course, ardently desired by every
planter: viz.: the pleasure of seeing rapidly rise
up before him, a healthy and most promising race
of trees.</p>

<p>The second mistake which I shall notice is a
very common one; and is committed by those
who <em>prepare the land well, but, by a bad selection
of plants</em>, either as to age, or kind, or both, render
success impossible. The error as to <em>age</em> consists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
most frequently, in their being <em>too old</em>: that as to
the <em>kind</em>, in not choosing such as <em>are adapted</em> to
the nature of the soil.</p>

<p>A third class of planters may be met with,
who, to a certain extent, avoid all the mistakes
previously referred to, but who commit the unaccountable
blunder of throwing the various kinds
promiscuously together, without any <em>regard to
congeniality as to the plants</em>; and in this case,
the trees that are really valuable are overtopped,
and mastered by a set of <em>worthless trash</em>, which,
when full grown, are hardly worth the trouble of
cutting down. <em>When a Plantation is made in this
barbarous manner, and left in this state for twenty
years, or even less</em>, no subsequent efforts, however
sound the judgment which is exercised may be,
can <em>wholly</em> repair the mischief which is done. By
this mistake, an immense loss of property accrues
to the proprietor, and the worst of all is, that the
trite consolation is not left him, that what is “his
loss, is another’s gain,” for here nobody is benefitted;
while to himself there is superadded the
mortification of a <em>loss of time</em>, “which no man
can restore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>That the strong language which I have here
employed is fully justified, will at once be admitted
by every reflecting person, who has any
acquaintance with these matters; for it will appear
at the outset, that if a slow-growing tree is
planted close to one which will grow half as fast
again, and if the slow grower is the tree <em>intended
for timber</em>, the latter must inevitably be so much
damaged as to affect its health for ever, if something
be not done to relieve it.</p>

<p>I shall not, in this place, “remark” more
particularly on this point, than to say, that I have
often seen the oak in this relative position, with
the alder, the birch, the poplar, the larch, and
other trees.</p>

<p>To imagine that a comparatively slow-growing
tree can be placed in near contiguity with
another whose rate of progress is much quicker,
<em>without</em> receiving injury, is to manifest a want
of knowledge of the habits of trees, which may be
excused in an amateur planter, but which cannot
be overlooked in a practical man, who is well
paid for his services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>A fourth error which is committed, is one
upon which I have slightly touched already, and
refers to the question of <em>adaptation of the kind of
tree planted</em>, first, to <em>the nature of the soil planted
upon</em>, and next, <em>if the object of the planter be
profit, to the local demand</em>.</p>

<p>Most serious mistakes have been committed
upon both these points, even by men whose writings
have procured them a niche in the Temple
of Fame. Under this head a few cases will now
be referred to.</p>

<p>It is impossible, at this distance of time, to fix
the exact amount of blame, or responsibility, which
of right attaches itself to the name of <em>Pontey</em>, for
instance, who planted an immense tract of land
near Lincoln, belonging to that splendid charity,
Christ’s Hospital: tradition, which, however, may
do him injustice, accuses him of having contracted
to plant with Larch and Oak, and
having, on some pretence or other, substituted
Scotch Fir.</p>

<p>Whatever was the precise amount of <em>responsibility</em>
attaching to him, I know not; he might
be following out the letter of his instructions, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
ought that I can tell, but it is quite certain that,
even with the then imperfect knowledge which
was possessed of the value of larch, <em>a very great
mistake</em> was committed, in planting nearly a
thousand acres of land, which was well adapted
both for oak and larch, with profitless rubbish like
that which is now seen upon it. A work of that
magnitude ought not to have been intrusted to any
one who, either from mercenary motives, or from
limited views, was capable of falling into such a
gross error, as to the interests of his employers.
It is no exaggeration to say, that if the Skellingthorpe
Plantation had been planted, as it ought to
have been, with oak and larch, together with a
few spruce firs, and if Pontey had left <em>suitable
instructions with those who had to take care of it,
after his superintendence had ceased</em>, it would
now have been, at the most moderate computation,
<em>fifteen hundred per cent. more valuable
than it is</em>!</p>

<p>If it were <em>private property</em>, I should not presume
to add what I now feel myself at perfect
liberty to do, with reference to its present condition,
and the future prospect respecting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>It is at present, almost universally, a <em>Scotch
Fir Plantation</em>: these are of a most miserable
size, compared with what they might have been,
under good management, and they are withal very
coarse. There may be seen amongst them, just
Larches enough to perpetuate the folly of the
original planter; and to excite, at his periodical
sales, the keen regret of the present Steward, that
he has not more of them to sell. There are also
a few oaks, of such quality as fully to prove that
they would have thriven well—had they been
planted. Further: the Scotch firs are so thick,
and they are <em>feathered down so low</em>, that the
Plantation is not <em>healthy</em>. It is true that, under
the present <em>much improved</em> management, an attempt
is being made to remedy this evil, and it is
quite clear, that the condition of the trees will
gradually be bettered, but the misfortune is—and
here I come to speak of the <em>prospects</em> of the
Plantation—that <em>they are not worth culture</em>. I
have no hesitation in stating this to be my deliberate
opinion. The timber, if timber it can be
called, is worth almost <em>nothing now</em>, and, in such
a locality, I can see no probability of its ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
realizing, so as to justify those in whose care it is
placed, in continuing it as it is. The plain and
obvious course of the managers of this fine estate,
then, is <em>to stub up the Scotch fir, and replant the
land with oak and larch</em>.</p>

<p>In further proof of the propriety of this opinion,
I would remark that, in this locality, both oak
and larch fetch <em>very high prices</em>, and there are
probable grounds for expecting that they always
will do so; while, if the present race of Scotch firs
should stand as long again as they have already
stood, they will make comparatively little.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say, that if this Plantation
were the property of a private gentleman,
the Scotch firs would be extirpated as speedily as
possible, and a systematic plan, providing that a
certain number of acres should be stubbed and
re-planted every year, would at once be laid down;
but public bodies are not so easily moved, and it
is therefore to be feared, that, in this case, the
<em>public</em> will not, for some time to come, derive that
benefit from the property, which would certainly
be the result of proper management.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The whole might be re-stocked with suitable
kinds of trees, without any considerable outlay to
the hospital, if arrangements were made with a
party capable of carrying out some such comprehensive
plan as the following; viz.: An agreement
with a responsible person, carefully worded, providing
that he should stub, or grub up, a stipulated
number of acres at the commencement of a sort
of lease, <em>taking the stuff</em>, either in part payment,
or wholly, if it were <em>sufficient</em>: and that he should,
on such terms as could be agreed upon, continue
to grub up, <em>and plant</em>, a specified number of acres
every succeeding year.</p>

<p>In twelve years, <em>if the work were well done</em>,
there would be some return from the <em>thinnings of
the piece first planted</em>; and the <em>rate of return</em> and
profit, would, from that time, <em>continue to increase</em>
every year, until an amount would be realized
which would much more than equal the largest
expectations of the Governors.</p>

<p>I shall only mention one case more, as to the
want of adaptation of the kind of tree <em>to the soil</em>,
and to the local demand, and that is a wood belonging
to the Right Honourable Lord Middleton, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Stapleford, near Newark, and which, some years
ago, consisted almost entirely of Scotch fir. It is
now of an age and size that enables me to cite it in
proof of the opinion which I have given, relative to
the <em>prospect</em> for the Skellingthorpe Plantation. The
timber has arrived at a good marketable size, and
is sold at as high a rate as there is any reason to
suppose would be made of the Skellingthorpe
Scotch, when it shall have reached to the same
size. That price is <em>apparently</em> moderate, but it
is so inferior in quality, or, perhaps, it is more
correct to say, such a bad opinion is formed of it,
by most people, that when it is converted into
boards or scantling, the price it fetches is so low
as to hold out little inducement to Timber merchants
to purchase it. And as to the grower,
I am persuaded that, if simple interest upon the
original investment were to be calculated, up
to the time when the wood first began to clear
its own expences, and added to the first cost, it
would not be found that there is much surplus
over the necessary expences of management. At
all events it would be seen there, as well as at
Skellingthorpe, from the little Larch and Oak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
which they have had to sell, that the returns are
comparatively small to what they would have been,
if Larch had first been planted along with Oak.
This large Plantation will, in the course of a few
years, under the present enlightened and skilful
management, to a great extent, be cleared of the
Scotch firs; in place of which, the noble proprietor
will have <em>a race of fine oaks</em>, thus proving, to
actual demonstration, the great mistake which was
originally committed, in occupying the land with
a class of trees which, when they have arrived at
<em>maturity</em>, are of comparatively little value.</p>

<p>I pass on to remark upon a fifth error. One
gentleman will, from motives of economy, <em>stick in
the plants with as little labour as possible</em>: another
will aim at the same result, by putting in fewer,
or smaller plants than he ought to do. Both these,
and indeed all the parties, who are influenced by
the same narrow and shortsighted views, greatly
err: these are not the <em>cheapest</em>, but the <em>most
expensive</em>, as well as the worst adapted, modes of
planting. To insure a healthy and vigorous <em>commencement</em>
to a Plantation, if that is followed up
by suitable treatment afterwards, is to secure both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
rapid progress, and early maturity, and by necessary
consequence, the largest possible amount of
pecuniary return.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to modes of planting, and without
ranging either party among those who are clearly
and decidedly <em>mistaken</em> in their views, one class
of persons will plant <em>thickly</em>, and another class will
plant <em>thinly</em>, from various motives, but both without
paying due regard to the capabilities, and
adaptation of the soil, and, as is very natural, in
the absence of all calculation, both are frequently
subjected to the same result,—either a partial or
complete failure of their expectations.</p>

<p>It is neither my purpose, nor is it in my
power, to decide, upon paper, what is the best
average distance at which the trees of a young
Plantation should be placed from each other.
Many questions ought to be previously asked, as
many very important considerations will present
themselves to the mind of a practical man, before
he will decide.</p>

<p>In the average of cases, where <em>planting for
profit</em> is the object, the question is not one of
much practical difficulty; but in many others,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the primary purpose, or the ultimate aim, of the
planter—the local market—the cost of plants, &amp;c.
will claim very special attention.</p>

<p>When the object is to beautify the Landscape,
or to produce effect in the immediate vicinity of a
Mansion, it will be necessary to set aside ordinary
rules, and to depart from <em>some</em> of the recognized
principles which ought always to govern, in planting
for profit. But even here, nothing should be
done, nothing should be attempted, which is not
in strict consistence with those general laws which
the principles of vegetable physiology impose,
alike on a Gentleman who removes a large tree
upon the plan recommended by Sir Henry Steuart,
and on the practical Planter, who is professionally
employed to plant a large tract of country.</p>

<p>It is no part of my business to remark upon
the merits of the respective plans which have
been tried by different persons, for enriching the
scenery of a Park; but I have no difficulty in
saying that, where it is well understood and properly
carried out, the combination of Sir Henry’s
plan, with the judicious arrangement of small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Plantations; putting into a well prepared soil,
good, stout, well-rooted, and vigorous plants, at a
considerable distance, will best effect that object.
And as I have referred to Sir Henry Steuart’s
method of removing large trees, it will not be out
of place here to observe, that the <em>abuse</em> of that
plan has very frequently brought it into disrepute,
and given birth to the conclusion, that it was not
adapted to the end proposed: and thus blame has
fallen on the ingenious, skilful, and scientific
Baronet, instead of its resting on the heads of
those whose “mismanagement” had actually invited
the failures which they were doomed to
suffer.</p>

<p>Those who have most carefully attended to
Sir Henry’s instructions in removing large subjects,
will have been most successful; and while
they will be the first to admit that the plan is one
of very considerable difficulty, and requiring the
greatest possible amount of attention; they will
be the most powerful and decided witnesses in its
favour, for the purposes for which it is here
recommended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>But when Plantations on a large scale are desired,
and when the planter considers his <em>posterity</em>
more than himself, there can be no doubt at all,
that, on certain qualities of soil, <em>tolerably thick</em>
planting is best. And if it be desired to have a
race of fine noble Oaks, they must be put in <em>very
thick</em>, and the planter must not expect, during a
life of average duration, <em>any profit at all</em>; for, in
order to secure his object, he must, first, <em>prepare
the ground well</em>: and next, he must either <em>sow
acorns</em>, or he must put in <em>an immense number of
plants</em>—and, in either case, he will incur a heavy
outlay. He must, for the first seven years, <em>keep
the ground clean</em>, and he must plant along with
the Oak, a selection of those kinds of trees, <em>as
nurses</em>, which are best adapted to the purpose, and
not those which might probably, at the earliest
period, find their way into the <em>local</em> market, and
make the best price when there; although these
points should not be left out of consideration.</p>

<p>But now, the question as to planting, or sowing,
or, if the former be preferred, that of the
distance of the plants, being settled, the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
which presents itself is this: what kinds shall be
planted as the</p>


<h3>Nurses for the Oak.</h3>

<p>Here again, a good deal will depend upon the
object of the planter, the nature of the soil, and
the exact arrangements which are made at the
time of planting; for it might be quite proper to
plant a species of Tree in one place, while,
owing to a difference in the staple or the condition
of the soil, it would be just the reverse
in another.</p>

<p>The remarks which I shall have to make on
this subject have, in some degree, been anticipated
by the observations which I have already made,
respecting the Skellingthorpe Plantation, but a
more particular reference to a few well-known
kinds, may not be amiss.</p>

<p>I begin with the <em>Larch</em>, which, from its great
value to Farmers and others, is fairly entitled to
precedence.</p>

<p>The Larch is found, in greater or smaller proportions,
in most places where Plantations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
made; and it is entirely the planter’s fault, if he
be not well acquainted with its character, as a
nurse for Oak. I say this, because it has been
so extensively tested, and its habits are so well
known, that no one, having the slightest wish to
become acquainted with it, can have failed for
want of opportunity.</p>

<p>I have very often seen the Larch where it has
proved an exceedingly bad nurse; where, in fact,
instead of nursing the Oaks, it has destroyed
them: but this has, of course, arisen from “mismanagement,”
and might have been avoided.
When good, stiff, healthy Oak Plants are put in
with Larch only, or but with very few of any
other sort, the Larch ought not, in the first
place, to be put <em>too near</em>—the exact distance
can only be determined relatively to that of the
Oaks—secondly: an advantage should be given
to the Oaks, if possible, <em>at the start</em>; either by
assigning them a portion of the soil from the land
intended for the Larch, or in some other way;
after which, if the latter are constantly watched,
they will approve themselves very suitable and
valuable nurses; but if they are allowed, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
too generally are, to take the lead of the Oak,
they will plentifully avail themselves of the licence,
to the serious and, perhaps, irreparable injury of
that plant.</p>

<p>For large Plantations, intended for profit, it
may be questioned whether, in the first instance,
any thing else than Oak and Larch should be
planted, and the distance must be decided after
due consideration is given to the quality and
condition of the land.</p>

<p>If, however, a disposition is felt to plant other
kinds, as nurses, there can be no objection, provided
that their companionship is made fully to
square with the well-being of the trees intended
for timber.</p>

<p>But where it is intended to introduce nothing
that shall not act as a good nurse for the Oak,
exception must certainly be taken to the Alder,
the Poplars, the Sycamore, the Horse Chesnut,
the Birch, and the Scotch Fir, &amp;c. Not one of
these discovers any congeniality for the Oak, nor
any fitness for the office of nursing it; and it
does really appear to my mind, as most unaccountably
strange, that trees of all sorts should, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
forethought, or calculation—and most particularly,
that no reference should be made to their suitability
or adaptation for the circumstances in
which they are to be placed—be planted at a
greater cost than would have sufficed to procure
an ample number of the right sort.</p>

<p>Upon a suitable soil, the Spruce Fir has always
appeared to me, to be decidedly and incomparably
the best nurse of the Oak. I have, for instance,
often seen, on a clay soil, a Spruce Fir, and an
Oak of twenty-five years growth, flourishing admirably,
in close proximity with each other—even
within a foot and a half. I do not think that this
could be said of any other tree than the Spruce
Fir; but besides this, there is almost always a
very peculiar healthiness about the Oaks, where
the Spruce has been planted and cherished as the
principal nurse. There seems to be the best possible
understanding between them—no struggling
for pre-eminence—no blighting influence exercised
by the one over the other. But the Spruce Fir is
not found to flourish so well on some soils as on
others: it will therefore, mostly, be advisable to
unite with it, for a number of years, the <em>Larch</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
which may be so placed as to be all weeded out
during the course of thinning, which ought to
commence in a few years after planting, and go
on until there remains nothing but Oak in possession
of the ground.</p>

<p>In concluding my remarks on Planting, I
cannot help referring to the specimens of sowing
and thick planting, which may be seen on the
extensive estate of the Duke of Portland, at
Welbeck, and in that neighbourhood. It has
always been His Grace’s practice, either to sow
Acorns, or to plant Oaks, in alternate beds,
having Larch between. If the Oaks were planted,
they were put in <em>very thickly</em>; and although their
progress was necessarily slower than it would
have been, if they had been allowed more room,
it cannot be doubted that His Grace had a great
advantage in the almost unlimited choice which
it gave him, of trees <em>of perfect form</em>, for the ultimate
crop of timber.</p>

<p>The system of <em>thick planting</em> has been fully
carried out: having prepared the ground well,
His Grace appears to have never lost sight, for an
instant, of the young trees that he had undertaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
to rear: there has been no mistaken practice—no
niggardly economy—no ruinous neglect, rendering
all his previous care abortive, and sacrificing his
large outlay at the commencement. When the
Plantations have required attention, they have
evidently had it.</p>

<p>The admirer of fine timber will see, in the
Duke’s Plantations and grounds, some of the most
perfectly formed trees that can be conceived of,
and that not on a small scale, but to an extent as
comprehensive as that truly noble Duke’s genius,
of whom it may probably be said that he unites,
in his mind and person, as many of those qualities
which constitute true Nobility, as any Gentleman
of his day.</p>

<p>It is not in the power of my feeble pen to
show the immense amount of good which has
accrued to the immediate neighbourhood, from
the employment of the poor in the locality, in
carrying on, and in completing, those splendid
improvements which His Grace has originated,
and which have caused the literal desert to “blossom
as the rose”: much less can I describe the
area of the vast circle, within which the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
beneficial effects have been felt, from the influence
of the noble Duke’s example, while perfecting, as
he has done, his various plans for the improvement
of his fine estate.</p>

<p>In the Welbeck Plantations will be found, as
I have said, a class of trees, most perfectly suited
to the situations where they stand, and giving the
surest promise of future superiority: but what,
let me ask, would have been the quality of the
Oaks, if the noble Duke had jumbled together an
incongruous admixture of <em>various sorts</em>, as has
been recommended by various writers of eminence,
even in our own day? I am not disposed to enter
into a controversy with any of those who have
recorded their opinions in their writings, otherwise
I might have plenty of work on my hands: it
will be quite as much as ought to be expected
from me, if I defend my own: but I would just
quote a single paragraph from an interesting and
useful, but, on some points, incorrect volume, published
by “The Society for the diffusion of Useful
Knowledge.” It is entitled “Useful and Ornamental
Planting.” The passage to which I refer,
will be found in the 43rd page, and runs thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Simple Plantations</em> consist of one or two species
of trees only; <em>mixed Plantations</em> of many different
species. The latter, on suitable soils, are the
most profitable: they afford an earlier, more permanent,
and a larger return for Capital than
simple Plantations.”</p>

<p>In a book where there is so much to commend,
where so many valuable practical directions are
given, it cannot but excite regret, to meet with
a paragraph so vague and unsatisfactory as the
above; for I cannot but remark, that if any planter
should adopt the suggestion which is thrown out,
it will end in disappointment and loss. It will, in
my judgment, generally be best for the planter to
select such trees for nurses as are most congenial,
and best adapted to the local market; and surely
these will not be the Birch, the Beech, the Alder,
or the Scotch Fir; none of which are ever found
to answer the purpose of nursing the more valuable
timber trees, or of securing a fair return for
the investment of capital.</p>

<p>It is true that the opinion which I have quoted,
is afterwards qualified by the remark, that certain
“circumstances connected with the growth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
various species of forest trees, effectually control
the planter in his modes of arrangement, &amp;c.” but
even with this limitation, the planter is liable to
be misled, for he is not taught to set a higher
value upon the Larch, which may in almost every
locality be planted with a much better chance
of profit, than the other kinds with which it is
ranked, and which ought therefore, if profit be the
object, for that reason alone, to be preferred.</p>

<p>In any thing else but planting, the mischief
of such a mistake, as producing that which was
worthless when produced, would, in a short time,
have cured itself; but so little of science, or
even of common calculation, have been brought
to bear upon the practice of Arboriculture, that,
notwithstanding the evidence which is every where
to be met with, of serious “loss and disappointment,”
for want of calculation, these matters go
on very much as they “always have done.”</p>

<p>Finally, as to planting, it must, in every case,
be perfectly clear to one who is competent to
judge, that, whether the object be profit merely,
or the embellishment of the landscape, the land
ought to be as well prepared as circumstances will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
permit, and that <em>such species of trees should be
preferred, as are best adapted to the specific object
of the planter</em>.</p>

<p>The distance at which the plants shall be put
in, is more a matter of opinion than some planters
would be inclined to admit. For myself, I am
disposed to think, that some advantages are lost
to a Plantation, under certain combinations of soil
and circumstances, when it is planted <em>thickly</em>, but
I would not either rate the loss too highly, or express
my opinion, with unseemly positiveness: my
notion is, that the supposed advantages of planting
thickly may generally be supplied by <em>early, judicious
pruning</em>, and that the progress of the Plantation
would be facilitated thereby: that, in fact,
a Plantation of trees at a distance of three feet,
being properly assorted, having had a good start,
and suitable treatment in all respects afterwards,
would reach any given point as to size, and
quality, in less time than would another Plantation,
upon the same soil, if the method of either
sowing acorns, &amp;c., or planting very thickly, were
adopted. In saying this, I by no means wish to
condemn the practice of thick planting; to do this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
in the face of proofs of success, such as I have
described as existing in this country, would be an
absurdity of which I would not willingly be
guilty; but at the same time, I would not hesitate
to range myself among those who <em>prefer</em>,
under ordinary circumstances, to plant at a moderate
distance, and rely upon <em>early pruning</em>, for
securing the object which the close planter has in
view, viz., length of bole, or stem, and clearness
of grain.</p>

<p>I come now to remark upon the</p>


<h3>Present mode of managing Plantations after
they are made.</h3>

<p>Abiding still, most strictly, by the rule laid
down for myself, to deal with every part of my
subject practically, I proceed to observe, that the
instances where Plantations are treated with due
regard to the principles of Arboricultural science,
are not the rule, but the exceptions to the rule, as
every scientific planter, who has looked round
him, must know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Instead of the trees intended for timber being
nursed with the tenderest care from their infancy—instead
of their being treated according to the
known and fixed laws which regulate, and effectually
control, the economy of vegetable life,
whether men attend to them or not—they too
frequently meet with treatment which is in direct
opposition to those laws. I shall show this as
clearly, and as plainly, as I can.</p>

<p>When a gentleman has decided to plant, when
he has fixed upon the right mode of doing it,
and has finished it in a proper manner; so far he
has done all that could be expected from him;
but if, after this, he leaves his Plantation to itself
for five, ten, or fifteen years, he transgresses the
laws to which I have referred; and his error is
one of <em>omission</em>.</p>

<p>Again: were the same gentleman, after the
lapse of ten years, or even less, to enter his Plantation,
and cut and thin <em>very freely</em>, he would
violate those laws by an error of <em>commission</em>, and
in this case, as well as the other, the Plantation
would very materially suffer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>A Plantation which should be subjected, at so
early a stage of its existence as ten or fifteen years,
to the ordeal of both these classes of errors, could
have but little chance of succeeding: it could not
be expected to make any more than very slow
progress after such treatment as this: and yet this
is exactly the way in which many Plantations are
managed, at <em>all</em> stages of their growth. I have
recently met with a splendid Larch Plantation,
which has never been thinned, from the first,
except by “fits and starts”; of which injudicious
treatment, I could see very serious “outward and
visible signs.” Although it is upon exceedingly
weak and poor land, it would have produced, <em>if it
had been properly managed</em>, a fine class of Larches,
which would have yielded to the proprietor an
abundant return upon his outlay. If any one
doubt this, let him look around and see if he cannot
find a Plantation of forty or fifty years growth,
which is crowded with trees—say of Larch only—and
he will, upon examination, perceive that there
are two or three distinct classes of trees still standing,
all of which ought, long before, to have been
taken out; and that there is <em>but one class of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Larches</em>, probably, which should be standing. The
other two classes which I have just mentioned,
would be found, if the fact could be clearly come
at, very nearly of the same size as they had been
many years before; inasmuch as they could not
possibly make any wood, being themselves overtopped
by their more thriving and vigorous neighbours.
It is perfectly obvious too, that the injury
arising to the Plantation would not stop here. So
long as under-strappers were allowed to remain,
they would, to a certain extent, have the effect of
preventing the admission of light and air into the
Plantation, which would materially affect the
health and the progress of the standard trees.</p>

<p>The errors of <em>omission</em> are both serious and
numerous: those of <em>commission</em>, great though
they be, are not equally so. The former are
generally first in the order of time, for where
one Plantation is injured from <em>too early thinning</em>,
there are ten that suffer for the want of it;
and this early neglect affects the vitality and
prosperity of a Plantation much more than might
be supposed. Omitting to do what ought to be
done will, however, be very prejudicial to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
health of Plantations at any stage of their existence,
and it is quite well known to the experienced
Forester, that they ought ever to be watched with
most tender care, until the planter is fully satisfied
that he has completed the nursing and training
of a sufficient number of standard trees, to furnish
the ultimate crop.</p>

<p>But errors of omission sometimes admit of
remedy; whereas, if injury is committed by excessive
thinning, or by cutting down trees which
ought to have remained, it is often difficult, and
sometimes impossible, to repair the mischief that
is done. Both the errors to which I have alluded,
must be avoided by the planter who would desire
to have a healthy and <em>continuously thriving</em>
Plantation.</p>

<p>Having considered well the following points,
viz., the preparation of his land—the selection of
the species of trees that he will plant—their size
and quality—and the distance at which they shall
stand from each other, he must remember that,
from the very first, they will not only require, but
they will well pay for, his closest attention. During
the first seven years, he may, probably, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
little else to do at them than to <em>keep the land
clean</em>; but this will, in some degree, depend upon
the distance which he has chosen for them; and
on the kind which he intends for the final crop of
timber. But whatever <em>they</em> may be—whether the
Oak alone, or along with some other species, the
trees intended for timber will demand the peculiar,
the unremitted, attention of the planter: his object
must ever be to deal with all the rest, with
distinct, direct, and positive reference to <em>the
careful nursing of those</em>: and it must always
be borne in mind, that whatever be the fate
of the <em>nurses</em>, those which I will again distinguish
from the rest, by calling them the <em>standard
trees</em>, must, if possible, be kept in vigorous
health. This can only be done, concurrently
with the ultimate object of securing great length
of bole, by <em>pruning</em> of some sort or other. If the
trees are so planted as to insure <em>natural</em> pruning,
no other, <em>except of the nurses</em>, will be required,
but the first operation will be <em>thinning</em>; which
should be done with great care and judgment.
Where it is not so done, it is more than probable
that trees will be taken which should have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
left, and the contrary. As it respects the Oak,
the principal point to be aimed at is, to spare all
those, as the thinning goes on, that have the best
defined heads. This will be an easy matter with
an experienced and well-taught planter, or woodman,
and the difficulty, if any there be, will be
less at each succeeding thinning, as the heads of
the trees develope themselves.</p>

<p>But when trees are not planted so thickly
as to insure length of bole by natural pruning,
they must be pruned with the knife and the
bill-hook, and the earlier the operation is begun,
the better.</p>

<p>I doubt not but some of my readers will stamp
this advice with their unqualified disapprobation.
It may be very good and correct notwithstanding.
My own experience, as well as that of many
others whom I have consulted, convinces me that
the notion, which so extensively prevails, as to
the injurious effects of pruning, is <em>decidedly incorrect</em>.
It may have had its origin in the evidence
of injury to timber, which has been furnished by
<em>injudicious pruning</em>; and thus what would have
else been universally seen to be necessary, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
come to be almost universally condemned: but
this is a common error, and has been too often
shown, to render it necessary for me to expose it
here. Some very valuable observations on pruning
have been published by Mr. Main, in his excellent
little work, entitled “The Forest Planter and
Pruner’s Assistant.” At page 53, the following
paragraph occurs: “But the only part of a woodman’s
duty which does not appear to be well
defined, or at least not generally agreed upon by
practical men, is relative to the necessity of carefully
pruning and managing the trees during the
first fifteen or twenty years of their growth.”</p>

<p>I quote the last member of the above with
entire approbation: that is, so far as the necessity
for pruning is recognized in it: and I further
think, that the reasons which are given by Mr.
Main for pruning, and the manner in which he
has illustrated his principle—the clear and satisfactory
way in which he has treated the whole
subject—entitle him to the confidence, and to the
thanks, of all who are interested in the growth
of trees. But I am very far indeed from agreeing
with him in the opinion so adventurously given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
that “the best methods of preparing the ground
for the reception of the plants—manner of transplanting—the
soils most suitable for each species—are
all <em>thoroughly</em> and <em>universally</em> understood.”
My belief is, on the contrary, that comparatively
few planters, or woodmen, <em>do</em> “<em>thoroughly</em>” understand
these matters. If they did, their practice
would not be so extensively wrong as it is. If
it were so, why have planters so widely differed?
Why is there seen such discrepancy in their modes
of management? But what does Mr. Main wish
his readers to understand by the term “<em>practical
men</em>”? If he refer to those who have the oversight
and the direction of the practical operations
included in the “preparation of the soil for the
reception of the plants—manner of transplanting—the
soils most suitable for each species, &amp;c.”; and
if he wish to convey the idea that, by this class of
persons, these points are “<em>thoroughly and universally
understood</em>,” I hold him to be wholly and
widely wrong: but if he only mean that <em>scientific
men</em>, who have well studied the subject, and who
have written upon it, and <em>really intelligent woodmen</em>,
are agreed as to the best practice, I do not greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
differ from him; nor do I conceive that the main
point, at which I have aimed in this publication,
will be at all affected by any concession which I
make to this effect: my principal object has been,
and will be, to show that, however clearly and
strongly may have been shown, <em>the propriety of
acting in conformity with the principles of science</em>,
in the original formation of Woods and Plantations,
in the planting of Hedge-row Timber, and in the
general management of them all, the <em>practice</em> of
“<em>practical men</em>,” has been, “except as before excepted,”
so bad, that the most charitable conclusion
which can be drawn is, that they “<em>thoroughly</em>”
<em>misunderstand</em> almost every part of the subject!
It seems rather to me, that instead of there being
only one point in their practice on which they
need enlightenment, that there is but one on which
they may be said to agree, and that is in a <em>thorough</em>
contempt for all rules, all principles, all science!
in other words, that this class of persons has displayed
an amount of ignorance, (which, however,
has been more their <em>misfortune</em> than their <em>fault</em>,)
and the want of a proper apprehension of the
nature and extent of their obligations, and duties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
which has no parallel in the management of any
other description of property.</p>

<p>But this is a digression: I pass on, therefore,
to the question of <em>pruning</em>, on which I would
again commend to the notice of my readers, the
valuable remarks of Mr. Main, as well as some
excellent practical observations from the pen of
that veteran in the service, Francis Blakie, Esq.,
late Steward to the Earl of Leicester, from whose
small pamphlet, entitled “A Treatise on the Management
of Hedges and Hedge-row Timber,” the
most useful information may be gathered.</p>

<p>Mr. Main’s is an able and lucid examination
of the question of pruning, and, to my thinking,
most fully and satisfactorily settles it. He shows
that when pruning is properly done, and when it
is commenced <em>early</em> enough, and so managed as to
secure the desired result in fifteen or twenty years,
it may not only be done with safety, and without
material injury to the timber, but that no other
plan or practice will answer so well. This he
clearly proves upon scientific data, familiarly illustrated
by numerous plates, and confirmed by
practical statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>If, however, it were only from <em>neglecting to
prune</em> that the Plantations of this kingdom had
gone wrong, the “mismanagement” would not
have furnished a subject for remarks so strong as
it now does; but, as I have stated over and over
again, the practice is, in most cases and on many
accounts, at every stage of their progress, almost
as bad as it can be.</p>

<p>The treatment which a Plantation ought to
receive, may be comprised in a very few words.
The principals will require pruning from an early
period after being planted, and the pruning must
be continued, more or less, according to circumstances,
either every year or every alternate year,
until it is from fifteen to twenty years old; and,
during the same period, a small portion of <em>thinning</em>
will probably be required. As to the <em>nurses</em>, they
must be watched constantly after the fourth year,
and they must be treated with sole reference to
the prosperity of the other trees; <em>they</em> may, therefore,
be pruned, or lopped in any way that will
best subserve that end. Of course I am now
speaking of Plantations where the trees are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
put nearer to each other than three feet, and
when, in consequence, they must have <em>artificial</em>
pruning.</p>

<p>In cases where pruning begins <em>soon enough</em>,
the question which has been raised as to the
manner of doing it—whether by <em>close</em> pruning,
<em>snag</em> pruning, or fore-shortening—will not apply.
All the principals should be <em>close pruned</em> with a
sharp instrument, care being taken not to wound
the bark too extensively. The principle to be
kept in view at all times, when dealing with a
Plantation, is, <em>to subject it to no sudden changes</em>,
but when pruning is found to be insufficient, to
commence a course of <em>gradual thinning</em>, which
shall not, in any considerable degree, at any period,
<em>disturb the temperature of the Plantation</em>. If this
point be duly attended to, and a sound judgment
be exercised in selecting the principals, the planter’s
most sanguine expectations will not be disappointed.</p>

<p>So far as I have ventured to offer suggestions
for the <em>proper</em> management of Plantations, I have
intended them to apply to such as are not over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
twenty years of age; but it is well known to all
who concern themselves in such matters, that a
class of Plantations ranging above that age, up
to forty or fifty, may be met with in various
localities, which stands much in need of better
“management.” In all cases of great neglect,
which has been continued more than twenty years,
the nicest judgment is necessary. The difficulty
is, however, always in proportion to the <em>degree</em> of
neglect. Where the trees have been put in thickly,
and nothing, or almost nothing, has been done,
little can be expected even from the most judicious
treatment; but still the means ought to be tried,
for one thing is quite certain, viz., that the longer
remedial steps are put off, the less chance there
must be of their doing any good.</p>

<p>If, when the Plantation has been thus neglected,
a person is called in who does not fully
understand what he is about, irreparable mischief
will be done: he is almost sure to thin <em>too freely</em>.
A proprietor of long neglected Plantations must,
therefore, be well assured beforehand, that the
person he employs will be guided in the course he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
takes by correct views, both practical and scientific,
upon the whole subject; and when such is
the case, the most suitable and appropriate plans
will be adopted.</p>

<p>Should any one demand of me before I close,
some data on which he may judge whether or
not a Plantation is in a condition requiring unusual
attention, I offer the following:</p>

<p>First: If, upon examination, it be found that
the trees intended for timber have not an aspect
and position superior to the others which are
around them:</p>

<p>Secondly: If, at any period after twenty years
from the time of planting, it be found difficult to
identify and point out the trees which are to be
the final crop:</p>

<p>Thirdly: When there are any decided indications
of a want of health and vigour, there is
proof sufficient that something more is required
to be done than has yet been done. The grosser
cases of Plantations which have never been entered
for any purpose, for five, ten, fifteen, or twenty
years together, need not be pointed at. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
one who sees them must perceive the necessity
of their being relieved without loss of time. No
plant, of which we have any knowledge, can
exist without light and air, and in proportion to
the extent to which they are excluded from Plantations,
will be the injurious effect produced upon
the health of the trees. In fact, it may be laid
down as a universal rule, that <em>in proportion
to the judgment and discrimination which are
exercised in gradually admitting both light and
air into Plantations, of almost every description</em>,
will be their healthy progress.</p>

<p>I conclude my remarks on this part of my
subject by observing that, having admitted, as I
most fully and readily do, that a <em>few</em> instances
may be met with in almost every county where
the science of Arboriculture is tolerably well
understood, and its principles carried out, I must
still contend that cases enough may be found—First;
of a want of preparation of the ground:
Secondly; of an improper selection of plants,
either as to kind or size: Thirdly; of an unsuitable
admixture of them: Fourthly; of mistakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
committed as to their distance from each other:
Fifthly; when they are injured for want of early
attention: Sixthly; when injury is done to them
for want of, or from imprudent, or excessive,
thinning, to fully justify me, or any one else, in
bringing before the public the “<em>mismanagement</em>”
of Plantations.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>In commencing this, the third part of my
subject, I am fully impressed with a sense of its
magnitude and difficulty; and nothing but a thorough
conviction resting on my own mind, of the
truth of the position which I have taken with
reference to the <em>present state</em>, and the <em>present
management</em> of Hedge-row Timber, would have
emboldened me to give expression to views which
cannot but be unpalatable to many, however just
they may be, and however strong their claim, to
the serious notice of others. I am fully prepared
to expect that censure may be dealt out by some,
in not very measured terms, but this does not
move me: having nothing but a plain, unvarnished
tale to tell, I shall tell that tale as fearlessly as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
I were about to pour sweetest music into the ears
of those who may read. I know whereof I speak;
and while I have as little fear of any one <em>successfully
attempting to disprove what I shall advance</em>,
as I have at present, I can contemplate, without
a single disturbed feeling, the liability to which
I shall assuredly expose myself, of having sundry
missiles thrown at me by those who are deeply
implicated in the present “mismanagement” of
this valuable property. Thus much with reference
to those who are in offices of trust and confidence,
as the managers of Woods, Plantations, and
<em>Hedge-Rows</em>, if any such shall favour me with
a perusal. But I may not proceed any further,
before I say a few words in deprecation of the
displeasure of a more important class of persons
who will, I trust, do me the honour to read my
“Remarks”; I mean, the proprietors of Hedge-row
Timber. To these—or rather to that portion
of them who have hitherto paid little attention to
this part of their property—I would say, let my
observations be “weighed in the balances,” and,
if they are “found wanting,” let these be set
against what cannot be called more than a venial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
error—an error of judgment—the strong, the ardent
desire that I have to see introduced the correction
of what I have, at least, <em>deemed</em> to be, a serious
mischief.</p>

<p>If Hedge-row Timber has been “mismanaged”—and
who can doubt it—on whom shall the
blame fall? As I have more than once said before,
<em>not</em> on a class of men who, from their education,
must necessarily be limited to the mechanical
duties connected with their office, but on the
Owners of Timber, from whom either directly, or
through the agency of persons duly qualified, such
rules and regulations ought to proceed, as would
insure a better system of management. Practices
are allowed, and such a state of things is permitted
by the proprietors of Hedge-row Timber, as abundantly
prove that many of them have never either
understood its value, or given themselves the trouble
to enquire whether it was under a course of
suitable treatment or not.</p>

<p>I have stated that I consider the question
which I am handling a difficult one. I feel it to
be so—not because I have any difficulty in proving
“mismanagement” on the part of those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
have to do with the timber of our hedges—not
because I can feel a <em>doubt</em> that my statements will
carry conviction along with them; but because
I must necessarily come into collision, both with
the refined tastes, and with the prejudices, of many
of my readers. For instance: if I assert, as I do
without any hesitation, that many Noblemen and
Gentlemen suffer their Hedge-row Timber <em>to stand
much too long</em>—where is the admirer of the beauties
of landscape scenery, who will not instantly,
and perhaps indignantly, throw down my book,
and charge me with being the most presumptuous
of grumblers, and, as to <em>taste</em>, a very heretic!</p>

<p>If to such a charge as this I plead “not guilty,”
as, after all that can be said, I really must do,
I am aware that I must be prepared with a very
strong defence. I think I am so prepared. My
defence will rest on three principal points, which
it will be my endeavour to bring out in the course
of my “Remarks: viz.: First; I shall show that
the magnitude of the sacrifice which arises from
Hedge-row Timber being suffered to stand so long,
is disproportionate to the good resulting from it.
Secondly; that the embellishment of a landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
does not necessarily include <em>the perpetuity</em> of any
one race of timber trees. And thirdly; that the
present mode of “mismanaging” Hedge-row Timber,
is a perpetual offence against good taste.”</p>

<p>Although I have arranged my three propositions
as above, I do not intend to bind myself to
take them up again, and dispose of them in consecutive
order: I have neither time nor the ability
to adapt my “remarks” to the niceties of exact
logical arrangement; it will be sufficient for me, if
I shall succeed in leaving upon the minds of those
who may read them, an impression of their truth.
If that result is arrived at, it surely will be quite
sufficient to draw the particular attention of proprietors
to the subject; which will be more than
half way towards securing the improvement which
is so loudly called for; and that would be as much
perhaps, as could at once be reasonably expected.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss to glance for an instant,
at the value of the property about which I am
writing. Few people, I imagine, have any proper
conception of the aggregate amount. It is, of
course, impossible to offer more than a conjecture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
on the subject; but probably it is not less, in England
alone, than One Hundred Millions sterling!</p>

<p>It is quite clear that a course of management
which only, in some of its details, falls short of
what it ought to be, would involve, as it affected
such an immense investment, a very serious loss
to somebody. How much more serious then, must
it be, if, not only some of the minor details of
management, but the entire course of treatment,
be radically wrong, as it respects a considerable
proportion, and very defective indeed as to the
remainder? It would be a waste of time to stop
here with a view to argue, in proof of what must
appear to every one to be nothing less than an
<em>axiom</em>.</p>

<p>That proprietors of Hedge-row Timber are not
solely influenced by considerations of taste in their
management of it, is most evident to an experienced
eye; but the <em>heavy loss</em>, which is consequent
upon allowing it to stand so long, has, probably,
never been fairly understood by them, or some
efforts would have been made to prevent it.</p>

<p>If a Nobleman or Gentleman merely suffered
his timber to stand <em>beyond maturity</em> in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
of his house, or on the domain where his
mansion stood, however extensive it might be:—or
if he generously spared the trees which, though at
a great distance from his residence, were so placed
as to enrich, if not constitute the principal beauty
of, some splendid scene in nature, no one, who
possesses a grain of taste, would regret it, but, on
the contrary, would feel grateful for this sacrifice
to one of the most hallowed emotions of the heart,
when surveying the Creator’s works, which are all
perfect; and the touches of whose pencil are all
loveliness—whether as seen in the refreshing beauty
of foliage which distinguishes the vernal season,
or the mellowed minglings of Autumn’s enchanting
exhibitions: but when it is considered, that a
majority of the Nobility and Gentry, thus treat
their <em>remote</em> and even <em>most distant</em> estates, where
besides, there is nothing particularly attractive in
the scenery, the propriety of the course which they
pursue may, I think, be fairly questioned. Some
other reason therefore, than a deference to the
principles of good taste must be found, in order to
account for their conduct; and in looking round for
a reason I should say, a good deal must be set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
down to <em>indifference</em>, and <em>pure neglect</em>. This I say,
because it will <em>not</em> admit of question, that <em>a most
extensive loss</em> arises, both to themselves, and the
community in consequence; and it is not often that
gentlemen wilfully close their eyes to the
importance of pecuniary considerations, except
there is some powerful and justifiable reason which
leads them to do so.</p>

<p>Without speculating further as to the precise
cause, it is certain that the amount of property
which is thus wasted, absolutely wasted—and in
almost every case without any advantage to any
party whatever—is enormous, as it would be easy
to show by statistical details and calculations, applying
to any estate where this <em>horror of felling
timber</em> may have existed for half a century. Were
this accurately done, there could not but be such
a showing, as would fully establish the truth of
what I have advanced. There would indeed be
no difficulty in fixing upon an estate, in any
locality, which would illustrate my position, but
I shall not here attempt it, for various reasons,
which will be obvious to all. It would be travelling
beyond the bounds of legitimate remark, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
I to refer <em>to any particular estate</em>, and any other
references, however accurate in point of fact, would
not be sufficiently specific. I would rather
recommend any gentleman whose estate may be
pretty well covered with timber, already, or long
since, arrived at maturity, to make as near an
estimate as he can of its present value, or procure
it to be made; and having calculated the amount
which would be exhibited of the gross sum at
<em>compound interest</em>, for any given term of years,
then let him “try back,” and endeavour to ascertain
what, according to this mode of calculation,
may have been his individual loss. But when a
gentleman coolly makes up his mind to allow his
Timber Trees to go to decay without ever <em>intending</em>,
or <em>wishing</em>, to make any thing of them, why
then, in that case, nothing can be advanced, but
to suggest the means of protracting their existence
to the longest possible period.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to do homage to the feeling
which prompts a gentleman to make so large a
sacrifice to taste, as to suffer the greater part of
his Hedge-row and detached Timber to perish by
slow decay; but if it can be proved that he acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
upon <em>mistaken views</em>, and that, by a better system
of management, his object might be gained
without the very serious pecuniary loss which, on
the other plan, he must necessarily suffer, it
cannot be doubted that such a suggestion ought
to command his instant attention. It will
hardly be denied, I think, by any one who fully
understands the subject, that <em>such a regular succession</em>
of Timber Trees in the Fields and Hedge-rows
might be secured by a proper system of
management, as would sustain and perpetuate the
beauties of the landscape, while, at the same time,
<em>nearly</em> every tree should be taken in its turn as it
arrived at maturity. It would, of course, require
an entire change of system, or rather of practice,
and the change would necessarily involve a considerable
outlay, inasmuch as a constant supervision
would be required from the time of planting,
but whatever might be the expense, it would be
amply returned; and whatever might be the apparent
difficulty, it would not be such but that
skill and perseverance would be sure to surmount
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>If then the objection which would be made by
the man of taste, to the felling of Hedge-row and
detached Timber, could be effectually obviated,
by providing a regular succession to take the
place of such as might be cut down—for the difference
of a few yards in the <em>site</em> need hardly be
taken into the account—one great difficulty, at
least, would be overcome; and instead of wasting,
as is done under the present practice, a quantity
of Timber, the aggregate value of which makes
it an object of <em>national</em> importance, the growers
might take down their trees when they arrived at
maturity, and thus produce a constant supply of
the best sort for home consumption: and it will
not surely be argued by the most determined advocate
for free trade, that it would be for the
interest of the English Gentleman to give a higher
price for Foreign Pine than he would be able to
make of home-grown Oak! No! emphatically
No!! When the navy requires it, by all means
let it be so appropriated, and if the demand be
sufficient from that quarter, the relative price will
be kept up, but let not English heart of Oak be
reduced in our home market below the value of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
inferior article, with all the costs of transit added
to the original price. This were indeed to show
a most extravagant and unaccountable preference
of a crotchet over the obvious dictates of reason,
and the suggestions of prudence. It would indeed
be to drop the substance, and grasp at the shadow.</p>

<p>I trust I may now conclude that I have satisfactorily
proved, not only that the “magnitude of
the sacrifice which the present practice involves
is disproportionate to the good resulting,” but that
“the embellishment of a landscape does not necessarily
include the perpetuity of any one race of
Trees.” In handling the remaining proposition,
and in endeavouring to prove that the present
treatment of Hedge-row Timber is “a perpetual
offence against good taste,” I shall at the same
time, be accumulating evidence in support of the
other two.</p>

<p>It is proper to remark before I proceed any
further, that when I speak of Timber being allowed
to stand too long, and of the consequent heavy loss
upon it to the proprietors, I refer to such as belongs
to the Nobility and Gentry, for, although their
example has in this, as well as in every thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
else, <em>some</em> effect upon those below them, it does
happen that, in this respect at least, the <em>middle
classes</em> are wiser in their day and generation than
their superiors, the Timber upon small estates
being generally taken down at an earlier period
than on large ones. There is indeed among the
higher orders—of course with a few exceptions—a
prejudice against felling Timber, older than the
oldest Timber Tree in existence; and as <em>strong</em>
as the most enthusiastic admirer of the beauties
of landscape scenery can desire it to be: and so
far is this feeling carried, that, by many, Timber
of the most unsightly character, and in situations
where it can be associated with no idea connected
with the scenery, is religiously spared, and spared
long after it has ceased to be either useful or ornamental
where it stands.</p>

<p>Having ventured thus strongly to point out
the loss to proprietors, I will now show, by an
example, how the community is affected by the
disinclination to fell one particular kind of timber;
viz., the Ash. This tree is hardly ever cut down
before it becomes exceedingly tender; and as
almost every agricultural implement is either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
wholly, or partly composed of it, the consumers—those
who wear out the wagons and carts, the
ploughs and harrows—are proportionate sufferers;
for it cannot for a moment be supposed, that timber
which is in the last stage of decay, or indeed,
approaching to that stage, will wear half so long
as that which is cut down as soon as it has arrived
at full maturity. The period when it has done so,
will be indicated to a practiced eye, at a single
glance, even with that class of trees which has
had fair play; or in other words, where <em>premature
decay</em> has not been brought on by mal-treatment.
But the latter class is by far the most numerous,
and it requires very little either of science, or of
knowledge of a practical kind, to teach a man how
to deal with them. It is of no use to let them
stand. If they are not wanted for ornament, the
sooner they are felled the better, for the process of
decay is very rapid in this particular tree. Their
early removal is further necessary, because they
injuriously affect the Farmer in another way, as
I will show.</p>

<p>The roots, &amp;c. of one single Ash Tree are said
to amount to a million in number, and to extend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
themselves as far all round the bole as the branches.
I do not profess to be able to form a very decided
opinion as to the number of the roots, rootlets,
fibres, &amp;c., but I have seen quite enough of
the habits of the tree to convince me, that the roots
extend themselves much farther than is here supposed;
and it is well known to all farmers, that
to a distance far beyond this, vegetation is almost
totally destroyed; and that, near a Hedge-row
(dividing two arable fields) which is filled with
filthy, scabbed, stunted Ash Trees, which, from
“mismanagement,” have been brought into such
a condition as positively to be making no progress
at all, <em>sow what he may</em>, the farmer can never
<em>reap</em> any thing: and yet these unsightly things,
which are the latest of all other of our common
deciduous trees, in getting their foliage, and almost
the earliest out again, are suffered to linger out
their <em>feeble</em>, but <em>blighting</em> existence, until by slow
decay they become so unsound, that the wind
blows them down, and they are fit for nothing but
the fire! or, if they do not actually reach this
stage, they are only cut down because the owner
has the fear of such a result before his eyes! A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
volume might be written with reference to this
particular tree, were it necessary to take up every
one of the points which present themselves, as
condemning the present practice in its management,
but that is not needed, for the <em>Ash Tree</em> is
so generally met with in a diseased state, that it
may be considered as the subject of grosser “<em>mis</em>-management”
than any other of our domestic
trees. If any one still deny this, let him look
round him and say, why Hedge-rows so abound
every where, in puny, sickly, Ash Timber, which
<em>cannot possibly attain to a useful size</em>: and when
he has confessed the fact, that they really <em>do</em> exist
in that state, I will reiterate the assertion, that the
cause is bad management! If <em>the present condition
of Hedge-row Ash, generally</em>, does not prove
“<em>mis</em>-management,” I am at a loss to know what
does, for when the different kinds are planted upon
a congenial soil, <em>if they be properly treated</em>, they will
continue to grow, more or less rapidly, according to
circumstances, and for a longer or shorter period,
as the natural term of their existence may rule: but
as they are now treated, <em>they are never healthy</em>,
for the principle of decay is introduced at a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
early stage of their existence, and in consequence,
premature old age is brought on. To the absence
of early training, may be attributed much of what
is seen to be wrong in the present condition and
quality of Hedge-row Timber, but much more to
the vile practice of <em>mutilating the trees</em>, which
almost every where obtains. There is, indeed, in
some quarters, such perfect indifference manifested
about the well-being of the trees, that <em>free licence</em>
is allowed to the tenants of the land to do as they
will with them: and <em>free use</em> they make of it, as
may well be supposed, and as is abundantly evident
in all such places. And why should it be
otherwise? It has so long been the practice, and
it is so far out of their way to really understand
the matter, that farmers may well be excused.
They cut off the roots, and reduce the extent of
the branches, of their enemy, in <em>self defence</em>; and
without having the remotest idea that they are
doing so serious an injury to the property of their
landlords. This is fully proved by the fact, that
they treat their own trees in precisely the same
way. It is, then, to the indifference that has
hitherto been manifested by the proprietors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Hedge-row Timber, and the consequent prevalence
of mistaken views on the subject, that the present
state of things is to be attributed. Some gentlemen
do indeed introduce into their Agreements, clauses
affecting to provide against the <em>mischievous pruning</em>
which is here condemned, but, except in the
neighbourhood of a mansion, where a strict look
out is generally kept, they are quite <em>inoperative</em>—they
are a dead letter, for not only does the <em>pruning</em>
go on, but, as I have just hinted, the trees are
often attacked <em>below too</em>, and deprived of their
<em>roots</em>, as well as their branches, thus cutting off
their supply of nutriment from the atmosphere
above, and from their legitimate sources of supply
from the soil. Both these practices ought to be
<em>most strictly interdicted</em>.</p>

<p>My indignation and regret have a thousand
times been excited, on seeing the noblest of all our
Hedge-row Trees, the Oak, clipped of its beautiful
proportions, and reduced by repeated <em>snaring</em>, as
it is most aptly called, to the capacity and shape
of a huge <em>besom</em>! and by this truly infamous treatment,
deprived not only of all its scenic beauty,
but actually of its specific character! and, if not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
altogether stopped in its growth, rendered utterly
worthless for application to the chief end and purpose
for which it is adapted and intended. I need
not say, that I mean—the building of ships.</p>

<p>Upon this subject there ought not to be two
opinions: neither will there, among those who
really understand it; but it is much to be lamented,
that a very large portion of the Hedge-row Timber
of this country is in the hands of persons who
either do <em>not</em> understand the management of it,
or who are indifferent about it. It very frequently
happens, that there is no person but the Land
Steward, who can make any pretensions to a correct
judgment in the matter, and he has often
quite enough to attend to, without so responsible a
duty as this is—being added to his department.
He therefore, very naturally, attends to those
duties which are indispensable; and as for the
Timber, &amp;c. &amp;c. he only thinks about <em>it</em> seriously,
when he wishes to ascertain <em>how much of it he
can turn to profit</em>.</p>

<p>Every considerable estate ought to have a person
upon it, whose attention shall <em>exclusively</em> be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
devoted to the supervision of the Woods, Plantations
and Hedge Rows, &amp;c. He should be a
<em>well-educated</em> and an intelligent man; and should
be so <em>well-paid for his services</em>, as to feel that his
employer has a moral claim upon him, for the entire
devotion of his <em>mind</em>, as well as his physical
powers, to the efficient discharge of his duties.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the <em>natural history</em> of Hedge-row
Timber, if I may so speak of it, would furnish
a field for highly interesting remark, and it would
assuredly remove any doubts that might remain in
the minds of those who have gone no farther than
to <em>suspect</em> that the management of it has been bad.
When it is considered that the Timber of our
Hedges is the product of <em>chance</em>, or even worse
than that, that it has grown to what it is, notwithstanding
that it has been subjected to the most
barbarous treatment; it is impossible not to perceive,
that if it had been watched and tended as it
<em>ought</em> to have been, it would have equalled any
thing that could have been conceived of it.</p>

<p>The classes of trees which may be met with in
our Hedge-rows are various, and are so situated in
many places, as to really give rise to the idea just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
now referred to—that they are found there, more
as a matter of chance, than of design: and this
may be assigned, partly at least, as the reason
why they have been so neglected, or so shamefully
used. If they had been planted, and if any calculation
at all were made before planting, it might
be imagined that a gentleman would wish to ascertain
what would be the <em>surest</em> mode of raising a
class of fine unblemished trees, whether they were
Oaks, or Elms, or Ash, or any other kind; and
having carefully, and at some expense, introduced
them into his hedges, it is difficult to suppose, that
he would either leave them to shift for themselves,
or to the tender mercies of their natural enemies,
the occupiers of the land on which they might be
growing: it is therefore more than probable, that a
considerable proportion of them are in the hedges
more by accident than any thing else. But however
that may be, the fact remains the same: they
are, very generally, standing memorials of the
ignorance of the men in whose care they have
been placed, and a triumphant vindication of the
propriety of my title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>If Hedge-row Trees have length of bole, they
have it—not because they were properly trained
and assisted when they were young, and therefore
needed it, but—in consequence, most likely, of
indiscriminate lopping and pruning at some former
period of their growth, the fruits of which, although
now invisible to the unpracticed eye, will appear
hereafter, to the dismay, and serious loss, of the
person who may have to saw them up.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere given my opinion very freely
on the subject of pruning, but as it will be necessary
just to glance at it, in connection with Hedge-row
Timber, I will again take the Oak, which is
almost the only tree that I would recommend for
hedges. As this noble tree will naturally grow
of a bush-like shape, when standing alone, it is
absolutely necessary that it be pruned, or it will
not acquire sufficient length of stem. I am not,
therefore, the wholesale condemner of pruning,
even of Hedge-row Trees, but I would have no
pruning done after they had arrived at a certain
age—say, twenty years: all work of this kind
should be done during the <em>infancy</em> of the tree, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
not at all. I would much sooner <em>cut down a tree,
if it had not sufficient length of bole</em>, and trust
to the chance of raising a better <em>from its stool</em>,
than take off <em>large branches, particularly if it
was not over thirty years of age</em>. Indeed the
former method of repairing the mischief of long
neglect, appears to me as one peculiarly adapted
to the circumstances in which some estates are
placed, as to the timber; and I should not hesitate
to adopt it upon an extensive scale. I have, in
fact, seen many estates where I should cut down
Oaks very freely, which have <em>not</em> length of bole, or
which, from some cause or other, are <em>not healthy</em>;
even though they might not produce timber enough
to pay for the cost of cutting. There are estates
within less than two hours ride of my residence,
which are <em>apparently</em> well stocked with timber,
but it is of such quality that, were it under my
own management, I should instantly cut it down;
and from a large proportion of the stools I should
train up a new race of trees. These would, if well
attended to, grow into a class and quality of timber,
very little, if at all, inferior to maiden trees;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
while, on the other hand, from those which are
standing, <em>whatever length of time they may
remain</em>, nothing can be expected, but a <em>small
quantity of timber, and that of middling quality</em>.
But to return to <em>pruning</em>. In a Wood, or a Plantation,
trees will draw up each other to a certain
length, and many of the lateral branches, from the
exclusion of light and air, will die, and some of
them will fall off; this is, of course, <em>natural</em> pruning:
but in a Hedge-row, they have no such help,
they will, therefore, require <em>artificial</em> pruning;
which should commence at the time of planting,
and continue until it can be seen that they will
assuredly acquire ample length of bole. The kind
of pruning which is here advocated <em>cannot possibly
do any harm, if it be well done</em>, and done at a
proper season. The soundness of an Oak will in
no degree be impaired by it; and consequently, it
will be, on all accounts, more serviceable for naval
purposes, than if it were not pruned; for it will
not surely be contended, that clearness of grain,
and length of stem, are not likely to recommend it to
the ship-builder. So far from having a doubt upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
this point, I am of opinion that timber thus carefully
trained, will be, on every account, <em>incomparably
superior</em> to that which is at present obtained from
our Hedge-rows;—it will exhibit a healthy developement,
from the pith to the alburnum; so that
wherever there is a <em>bend</em>, a <em>crook</em>, or a <em>knee</em>, in it,
the purchaser will be sure that it is <em>sound</em>—whereas
the very opposite is the case with by far the
greater part of that which now comes into the
market. The reckless extent to which the abominable
practice of pruning, lopping, or <em>snaring</em>—whichever
it may be called—is carried, renders
the conversion of timber a very hazardous speculation,
and should long since have taught the
growers of it, to avoid the commission of such an
error themselves, and to impose a heavy penalty
on all those belonging to them, who should be
found guilty of it.</p>

<p>To illustrate a little further the statement here
made, and the opinion here given, it may be remarked,
that the effect of such a vile mutilation
of Hedge-row Timber as is, in almost every quarter,
permitted, is seen and felt most in those very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
parts where strength is most wanted, and which,
<em>if sound</em>, would render the timber so much the
more valuable. It is on the outsides of <em>bends</em> or
<em>knees</em>, that blemishes are so frequently found, and
which are often so considerable, as to reduce the
value of a valuable crook to almost nothing.</p>

<p>These defects in timber are sometimes so far
within the body of the tree, as to elude the scrutiny
of the keenest eye, proving, in some very old trees,
that pruning is not an evil of modern date. In a
still greater proportion, as to the whole quantity,
however, the eye of Ship-builders, or Timber
Merchants—all of whom have frequently been
bitten—will detect, from external appearances, the
<em>snag-pruning, covered over both with wood and
bark</em>; and consequently, they protect themselves
as well as they can in their purchases, against the
contingency of unsound timber, by shaping their
offers accordingly. This, of course, affects the
<em>seller</em> in no inconsiderable degree, and is one other
reason why he should put a stop to the practice of
pruning altogether, except when it could be done
under the eye of his own Wood Manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>The last point connected with Hedge-row
Trees which I shall mention, is the <em>planting</em> of
them; but upon this part of the subject, I shall not
say much. I might, indeed, have passed it over
in silence, and still have fulfilled the requirements
of my Title-page; but inasmuch as the planting
of Hedge-row Timber, <em>must</em> form a part of an
<em>improved</em> system of management, however it may
be left out of the present practice, it does not seem
quite right to overlook it altogether.</p>

<p>If Hedge-row Trees are to succeed at all, they
must have a <em>good start</em>; and if they are to have
a <em>good start</em>, there must, of necessity, be some
trouble bestowed in the preparation of the site on
which they are to be planted. In the fences of
<em>new inclosures</em> there will be no difficulty at all.
If the border, as it is often called, be well prepared
for the <em>quick</em>, it will be in a right state for an Oak
Tree; and it would really appear to be a piece
of unaccountable neglect—an inexplainable circumstance,
as the act of a man of business—if a
tract of land were to be enclosed, and new fences
put down, without the opportunity being seized to
plant a suitable number of Oak Trees. I say, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
<em>Oak</em> Trees, because I am persuaded that it would
be very difficult indeed to find a locality where
any other kind of timber, other circumstances
being equal, would be likely to pay so well. In
the line of every Quick fence, then, I should certainly
recommend that healthy Oak Plants, of
four years old, which have been at least twice
transplanted in the nursery, should be inserted, at
a distance from each other—say, of twenty yards—and
if they are properly guarded and <em>nursed</em>,
nothing is more certain, than that they will become
a fine race of trees. But planting young Oaks, or
young trees of any kind, in an <em>old Hedge-row</em>, is
quite a different affair. It is indeed an undertaking
involving real difficulty, and requiring a
very considerable degree of skill on the part of the
workman, and of firmness and determination on
the part of his employer.</p>

<p>It would be found all but impossible to rear a
young Oak <em>in the exact line</em> of an old and vigorous
thorn hedge; but there are many situations which
present much less difficulty. For example: In
the year when a hedge is plashed or laid, where
there is a moderate space on the bank which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
been raised when the quick was first planted—say,
of a foot or more—there will be room for a tree;
and in all cases, where the bank has not been
<em>pared down</em>, there will be more room than is here
supposed. Many other places, such as the sides
of the banks of large ditches, the gaps of hedges,
&amp;c. &amp;c. may be met with, on almost every estate,
which ought to be filled with Oaks, after the
ground has been prepared in a suitable manner.</p>

<p>But, <em>a previous preparation of the plant is
necessary</em>. Planting in Hedge-rows, where planting
has been done at all, has been performed in
the same ill-adapted way as every thing else relating
to timber. The plants have been taken out
of the nursery, indiscriminately with others, which
have been intended for close planting; instead
of having such, and such only, as have been
<em>twice or thrice shifted</em>, and each time into a more
exposed situation, and wider apart, in order that
they might acquire more fibrous roots, and induration
of bark, and thus be enabled to cope with,
and surmount, the disadvantages of their new
position. Another point, which has previously
been hinted at, is the <em>guarding</em> of the trees. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
matter what the expense may be, if a gentleman
determines to have Hedge-row Timber, <em>he must
guard it well</em>. It stands more in need of the
watchful eye of the Wood Manager than almost
any thing else: in fact, it is of little or no use
planting at all, if a good and sufficient guard fence
be not immediately put down: but, having put in
good plants, and effectually protected them, I say
again, I know of no reason why Hedge-row Timber
should not thrive and prosper, and, ultimately,
turn out as sound, as any other. That it is not
so with the race of Timber Trees now growing,
except to a very limited extent, I assert without
fear of contradiction; and, with the same confidence,
I plead this fact as my justification, when
I re-assert, that their treatment, from first to last,
is neither more nor less, than a course of gross
“<span class="allsmcap">MISMANAGEMENT</span>.”</p>
